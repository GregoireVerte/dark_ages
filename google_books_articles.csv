The Ayyubid Era. Art and Architecture in Medieval Syria,"Abd al-Razzaq Moaz, , , , , , , , , Yasser Tabbaa, Zina Takieddine, Verena Daiber, Dina Bakkour, Wa'al Hafian, Haytham Hasan, Balázs Mayor, Benjamin Michaudel","Museum With No Frontiers, MWNF (Museum Ohne Grenzen)",2015,"This new MWNF Travel Book was conceived not long before the war started. All texts refer to the pre-war situation and are our expression of hope that Syria, a land that witnessed the evolution of civilisation since the beginnings of human history, may soon become a place of peace and the driving force behind a new and peaceful beginning for the entire region. Bilad al-Sham testifies to a thorough and strategic programme of urban reconstruction and reunification during the 12th and 13th centuries. Amidst a period of fragmentation, visionary leadership came with the Atabeg Nur al-Din Zangi. He revived Syria’s cities as safe havens to restore order. His most agile Kurdish general, Salah al-Din (Saladin), assumed power after he died and unified Egypt and Sham into one force capable of re-conquering Jerusalem from the Crusaders. The Ayyubid Empire flourished and continued the policy of patronage. Though short-lived, this era held long-lasting resonance for the region. Its recognisable architectural aesthetic – austere, yet robust and perfected ‒ survived until modern times. The Ayyubid Era: Art and Architecture in Medieval Syria describes eight thematic Itineraries including, among others, the cities of Damascus, Bosra, Homs, Hama, Aleppo and Raqqa.",342,Art,en,9783902782175,ayyubid

"Coptic Identity and Ayyubid Politics in Egypt, 1218-1250",Kurt J. Werthmuller,American Univ in Cairo Press,2010,"Using the life and writings of Cyril III Ibn Laqlaq, 75th patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church, along with a variety of Christian and Muslim chroniclers, this study explores the identity and context of the Christian community of Egypt and its relations with the leadership of the Ayyubid dynasty in the early thirteenth century. Kurt Werthmuller introduces new scholarship that illuminates the varied relationships between medieval Christians of Egypt and their Muslim neighbors. Demonstrating that the Coptic community was neither passive nor static, the author discusses the active role played by the Copts in the formation and evolution of their own identity within the wider political and societal context of this period. In particular, he examines the boundaries between Copts and the wider Egyptian society in the Ayyubid period in three ""in-between spaces"": patriarchal authority, religious conversion, and monasticism.",212,History,en,9774163451,ayyubid

Chapter three deals with Jerusalem in the political context of the Ayyubid state: the role Jerusalem played in the propagation of jihad against the Franks; the administrative and demographic changes introduced by the Ayyubids.

"The Sharafnama, Or, The History of the Kurdish Nation, 1597","Sharaf Khān Bidlīsī, Mehrdad R. Izady",Mazda Publishers,2005,"""In the pages of the Sharafnama are present the Kurdish nation, already unified 400 years ago within a common culture, national ethos, a defined homeland and an integrated history stretching into antiquity. In the text of this unique history the empires of the Kurds parallel those of the Arabs, Persians and Turks, some, according to Bitlisi, reaching back over 4,000 years. As the Kurds continue their arduous journey to regain their proper position as the fourth largest ethnic group in the greater Middle East, it is clear why the Sharafnama has gained the status of a national document and the locus classicus of Kurdish authenticity. The great prestige of the Sharafnama as a national history among the Kurdish literati and rulers has lasted for centuries. To gain the honor of being mentioned in the Sharafnama enticed later Kurdish dynasties to shuffle their own dynastic history into the pages of the book long after Bitlisi's death. Meanwhile, due to the pristine condition of its surviving manuscripts, the Sharafnama has and continues to serve as a primary resource to compare and correct the scribal errors found in other histories written in Persian language before 1597. The Sharafnama also contains invaluable information on the Kurds' neighboring peoples and dynasties who interacted with the Kurds, as well as the empires that emerged and weathered in the area.""",320,History,en,,ayyubid

The Fall of Rome And the End of Civilization,Bryan Ward-Perkins,OUP Oxford,2006-07-12,"Why did Rome fall? Vicious barbarian invasions during the fifth century resulted in the cataclysmic end of the world's most powerful civilization, and a 'dark age' for its conquered peoples. Or did it? The dominant view of this period today is that the 'fall of Rome' was a largely peaceful transition to Germanic rule, and the start of a positive cultural transformation. Bryan Ward-Perkins encourages every reader to think again by reclaiming the drama and violence of the last days of the Roman world, and reminding us of the very real horrors of barbarian occupation. Attacking new sources with relish and making use of a range of contemporary archaeological evidence, he looks at both the wider explanations for the disintegration of the Roman world and also the consequences for the lives of everyday Romans, in a world of economic collapse, marauding barbarians, and the rise of a new religious orthodoxy. He also looks at how and why successive generations have understood this period differently, and why the story is still so significant today.",358,History,en,9780191622366,fall of rome

The Sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 A.D. The History of the Event That Marked the Final Decline of the Western Roman Empire,Charles River Charles River Editors,CreateSpace,2014-12-20,"*Includes pictures *Includes ancient accounts describing the sack *Includes a bibliography for further reading *Includes a table of contents ""The City which had taken the whole world was itself taken."" - St. Jerome For the people of the ancient Mediterranean and beyond, the city of Rome had been a symbol of power for centuries, and entering the early 5th century A.D., the Eternal City hadn't been taken by an enemy force since the Gauls had done it about 800 years, an unheard of period of tranquility in a world wracked with almost constant warfare. Thus, when the Visigoths, who the Romans considered uncultured and inferior, took the city of Rome and sacked it in 410, the world was stunned. It made theologians of the newly Christianized empire question God's plan on Earth, and it encouraged many leading Romans to look east to Constantinople for their future. Indeed, the Western Roman Empire would completely collapse in the late 5th century, less than 70 years after the Visigoths sacked Rome, and just how it went from being a superpower to a poorly led, weak, and vulnerable shadow of its former self has preoccupied historians for centuries. To this day, it remains difficult to trace just when the decline began, but it's fair to say that the sack of Rome was the result of a number of factors that had been coalescing for many years. Only Roman arrogance kept the empire from seeing the grave peril its capital was in, which helped bring about the events leading up to that fateful day, but either way, the sack of Rome had world-changing ramifications. The Sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 A.D. analyzes the history and legacy of the most famous sack of the Eternal City. Along with pictures depicting important people, places, and events, you will learn about the 410 Sack of Rome like never before, in no time at all.",46,,en,1505658225,sack of rome 410

The Plight of Rome in the Fifth Century AD,Mark Merrony,Routledge,2017-07-06,"The Plight of Rome in the Fifth Century AD argues that the fall of the western Roman Empire was rooted in a significant drop in war booty, agricultural productivity, and mineral resources. Merrony proposes that a dependency on the three economic components was established with the Principate, when a precedent was set for an unsustainable threshold on military spending. Drawing on literary and archaeological data, this volume establishes a correspondence between booty (in the form of slaves and precious metals) from foreign campaigns and public building programmes, and how this equilibrium was upset after the Empire reached its full expansion and began to contract in the third century. It is contended that this trend was exacerbated by the systematic loss of agricultural productivity (principally grain, but also livestock), as successive barbarian tribes were settled and wrested control from the imperial authorities in the fifth century. Merrony explores how Rome was weakened and divided, unable to pay its army, feed its people, or support the imperial bureaucracy – and how this contributed to its administrative collapse.",257,History,en,9781351702782,sack of rome 455

Clovis’ victory proved a crucial step in the expulsion of the Visigoths from Francia into Spain, thereby leaving Gaul largely to the Franks. It was arguably in the wake of Vouillé that Gaul became Francia, and that “France began.” The editors have united an international team of experts on Late Antiquity and the Merovingian Kingdoms to reexamine the battle from multiple as well as interdisciplinary perspectives. The contributions address questions of military strategy, geographical location, archaeological footprint, political background, religious propaganda, consequences (both in Francia and in Italy), and significance.

"The Huns, Rome and the Birth of Europe",Hyun Jin Kim,Cambridge University Press,2013-04-18,"The Huns have often been treated as primitive barbarians with no advanced political organisation. Their place of origin was the so-called 'backward steppe'. It has been argued that whatever political organisation they achieved they owed to the 'civilizing influence' of the Germanic peoples they encountered as they moved west. This book argues that the steppes of Inner Asia were far from 'backward' and that the image of the primitive Huns is vastly misleading. They already possessed a highly sophisticated political culture while still in Inner Asia and, far from being passive recipients of advanced culture from the West, they passed on important elements of Central Eurasian culture to early medieval Europe, which they helped create. Their expansion also marked the beginning of a millennium of virtual monopoly of world power by empires originating in the steppes of Inner Asia. The rise of the Hunnic Empire was truly a geopolitical revolution.",347,History,en,9781107067226,battle of chalons
The Huns,Hyun Jin Kim,Routledge,2015-11-19,"This volume is a concise introduction to the history and culture of the Huns. This ancient people had a famous reputation in Eurasian Late Antiquity. However, their history has often been evaluated as a footnote in the histories of the later Roman Empire and early Germanic peoples. Kim addresses this imbalance and challenges the commonly held assumption that the Huns were a savage people who contributed little to world history, examining striking geopolitical changes brought about by the Hunnic expansion over much of continental Eurasia and revealing the Huns' contribution to European, Iranian, Chinese and Indian civilization and statecraft. By examining Hunnic culture as a Eurasian whole, The Huns provides a full picture of their society which demonstrates that this was a complex group with a wide variety of ethnic and linguistic identities. Making available critical information from both primary and secondary sources regarding the Huns' Inner Asian origins, which would otherwise be largely unavailable to most English speaking students and Classical scholars, this is a crucial tool for those interested in the study of Eurasian Late Antiquity.",204,History,en,9781317340904,battle of chalons

"Theoderic the Great King of Goths, Ruler of Romans",Hans-Ulrich Wiemer,Yale University Press,2023-07-25,"The first full-scale history of Theoderic and the Goths in more than seventy-five years, tracing the transformation of a divided kingdom into a great power In the year 493, the leader of a vast confederation of Gothic warriors, their wives, and children personally cut down Odoacer, the man famous for deposing the last Roman emperor in 476. That leader became Theoderic the Great (454–526). This engaging history of his life and reign immerses readers in the world of the warrior-king who ushered in decades of peace and stability in Italy as king of Goths and Romans. Theoderic transformed his roving “warrior nation” from the periphery of the Roman world into a standing army that protected his taxpaying Roman subjects with the support of the Roman elite. With a ruling strategy of “integration through separation,” Theoderic not only stabilized Italy but also extended his kingdom to the western Balkans, southern France, and the Iberian Peninsula.

Relying primarily on Italian textual and material evidence, Jonathan J. Arnold demonstrates that the subjects of the Ostrogothic kingdom viewed it as a revived Roman Empire and its king, Theoderic, as its emperor. Most accounts of Roman history end with the fall of Rome in 476 or see the Ostrogothic kingdom as a barbarous imitator.

Theoderic in Italy,John Moorhead,,1992,"The career of Theoderic the Ostrogoth is one of the great success stories of antiquity. From being a ruler of a barbarian people wandering around the Balkans, he became king in Italy (493-526) and established one of the most powerful of the post-Roman states. Due to its ample documentation, the Italy of Theoderic allows detailed examination of a period on the frontiers of ancient and medieval, Roman and barbarian. And due to his success in attracting the attention of some of the major literary figures of the time, new light is cast on Boethius, Cassiodorus, and Ennodius when they are considered in the context of their connections with the government. Yet Theoderic's reign, so praised by contemporaries, ended amid tension and discord. In this study, Moorhead considers whether the principles with which he governed brought about the impermanence of his achievement.",320,Biography & Autobiography,en,,theoderic

"Justinian's Flea Plague, Empire and the Birth of Europe",William Rosen,Random House,2010-08-03,"In the middle of the sixth century, the world's smallest organism collided with the world's mightiest empire. With the death of twenty-five million people, the Roman Empire, under her last great emperor, Justinian, was decimated. Before Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that carries bubonic plague, was finished, both the Roman and Persian empires were easy pickings for the armies of Muhammad on their conquering march out of Arabia. In its wake, the plague - history's first pandemic - marked the transition from the age of Mediterranean empires to the age of European nation-states - from antiquity to the medieval world.

What happened in 6th Century World Edition,Dr. Hau B Lau,HBL Press,2025-08-09,"The Sixth Century: The Last Classical Restoration and the Medieval Dawn (500-600 CE) The sixth century stands as one of history's most pivotal eras—the final attempt at classical restoration before the irreversible transition to the medieval world. This comprehensive volume chronicles a century of extraordinary ambition, catastrophic plague, and fundamental transformation that bridged the ancient and medieval worlds. At the century's heart lies the towering figure of Emperor Justinian I and his unprecedented attempt to restore the Roman Empire to its former glory. Through meticulous military campaigns, revolutionary legal codification, and architectural marvels like the Hagia Sophia, Justinian sought to resurrect classical greatness. Yet his grand vision collided with the brutal reality of the Plague of Justinian—a demographic catastrophe that devastated populations from Constantinople to China and effectively ended the classical world. This volume explores the century's dual nature of restoration and collapse. While Justinian battled to reconquer the West, the Sui Dynasty successfully reunified China after centuries of division, constructing the Grand Canal and establishing foundations for future imperial glory. The Sasanian Empire reached its zenith as a third superpower, challenging both Byzantine and emerging Islamic powers. Meanwhile, Germanic kingdoms solidified their hold on former Roman territories, creating innovative Romano-barbarian syntheses that would shape medieval Europe. From the Silk Road's flourishing trade networks to the revolutionary Rule of Saint Benedict that transformed Western monasticism, from Theodora's unprecedented empress power to the theological controversies that fractured Christianity, this century witnessed transformations that echo through history. The Gothic Wars devastated Italy, Slavic migrations permanently altered the Balkans, and the collapse of classical urban civilization gave birth to fortified medieval towns. Drawing on the latest archaeological evidence and scholarly research, this volume presents the sixth century not merely as a bridge between worlds, but as a transformative era whose innovations, catastrophes, and adaptations fundamentally shaped the medieval millennium that followed. It reveals how humanity's last great attempt at classical restoration ultimately created the foundations for an entirely new civilization.",182,History,en,,justinian reconquest

The Plague of Justinian A Pandemic That Shaped the Byzantine World,EMILY. WILSON,Independently Published,2025-01-18,"Title: The Plague of Justinian: A Pandemic That Shaped the Byzantine World Author: Emily Wilson Genre: Historical Non-Fiction Publication Date: 2025 Overview: Emily Wilson's The Plague of Justinian: A Pandemic That Shaped the Byzantine World delves into one of history's most devastating pandemics, which ravaged the Byzantine Empire between 541 and 549 CE. Drawing on primary sources, modern scholarship, and scientific insights, this book explores the social, economic, political, and cultural upheavals caused by the plague and its enduring impact on the medieval world. Key Themes: Historical Context The book introduces the Byzantine Empire in its 6th-century zenith, led by Emperor Justinian I. It paints a vivid picture of a dynamic empire characterized by grand architectural achievements like the Hagia Sophia, flourishing trade networks, and a complex social hierarchy. This context sets the stage for understanding how the pandemic reshaped the empire's trajectory. The Outbreak and Spread The plague, caused by Yersinia pestis and transmitted via fleas on rodents, is traced from its origins in Egypt to its rapid dissemination through Byzantine trade routes and urban centers. The book details how dense populations, poor sanitation, and global connectivity fueled the pandemic's spread, decimating entire cities and regions. Demographic and Economic Impact With an estimated death toll of 25-50 million people, the pandemic left catastrophic demographic gaps, triggering labor shortages and economic turmoil. Urban centers like Constantinople suffered immense population losses, leading to disrupted trade, reduced agricultural output, and weakened military capabilities. Imperial and Political Responses Wilson examines Emperor Justinian's initial focus on territorial expansion and grand projects, which had to shift towards crisis management. His responses-such as establishing quarantine measures, funding medical care, and introducing emergency taxation-are critiqued for their efficacy and limitations. Socio-Cultural Changes The pandemic intensified religiosity, with the Orthodox Church playing a central role in offering solace and guiding public morality. Artistic and architectural expressions during and after the plague reflected a society grappling with trauma and transformation. Additionally, traditional social hierarchies were disrupted, providing opportunities for greater social mobility. Comparative Analysis with Other Pandemics The book situates the Plague of Justinian within the broader history of pandemics, comparing it to the Black Death, Spanish Flu, and more recent outbreaks like COVID-19. This comparison highlights the unique features of the Justinian Plague while drawing parallels in human resilience and adaptive strategies. Environmental and Ecological Factors Wilson explores the role of climate change, urban density, and agricultural practices in exacerbating the plague's severity. Environmental disruptions such as cooler temperatures and increased rodent populations are identified as contributing factors. The book is organized into ten chapters, each addressing a different aspect of the pandemic: Chapter 1: Introduction to the Plague of Justinian Chapter 2: Byzantine Society on the Eve of the Pandemic Chapter 3: Origins and Spread of the Plague Chapter 4: Socioeconomic Impacts Chapter 5: Justinian's Response to the Crisis Chapter 6: The Plague's Role in Shaping Politics and Culture Chapter 7: Demographic and Environmental Consequences Chapter 8: Trade and Commerce Disruptions Chapter 9: Religious and Cultural Responses Chapter 10: Legacy in History",0,History,en,9798307432686,plague of justinian

The Wars of Justinian I,Michael Whitby,Pen and Sword Military,2021-10-31,"This ancient Roman history examines the military campaigns of Justinian I, from army organization to tactics and strategy—with maps and battle diagrams. Justinian I was the last great Roman conqueror. Though he never led an army in person, his leadership dramatically increased the size of his realm. His long reign, from 527 to 565, was devoted to the renovatio imperii, or renovation of Empire. His will and vision drove the reconquest of Italy from the Ostrogoths, North Africa from the Vandals, and parts of Spain from the Visigoths. These grand schemes were largely accomplished through the services of two talented generals, Belisarius and Narses. They were successful in spite of concurrent wars against the Persians and the devastation caused by bubonic plague. In this comprehensive study, Michael Whitby draws on the full range of sources to examine all of Justinian's campaigns. Besides narrating the course and outcome of these wars, Whitby analyses the Roman army of the period, considering its equipment, organization, leadership, strategy and tactics, and considers the longer-term impact of Justinian’s military ventures on the stability of the empire.",445,History,en,9781526760890,plague of justinian

"The Battle of the Catalaunian Fields AD 451 Flavius Aetius, Attila the Hun and the Transformation of Gaul",Evan Michael Schultheis,Pen and Sword,2019-01-30,"A reassessment of the famous fifth-century clash between Hun and Roman forces: “An excellent job of research with original documents.” —The Past in Review This book reconsiders the evidence for Attila the Hun’s most famous battle, the climax of his invasion of the Western Roman Empire that had reached as far as Orleans in France. Traditionally considered one of the pivotal battles in European history, saving the West from conquest by the Huns, the Catalaunian Fields is here revealed to be significant but less immediately decisive than claimed. This new study exposes oversimplified views of Attila’s army, which was a sophisticated and complex all-arms force, drawn from the Huns and their many allies and subjects. The ‘Roman’ forces, largely consisting of Visigoth and Alan allies, are also analyzed in detail. The author, a reenactor of the period, describes the motives and tactics of both sides. Drawing on the latest historiography and research of the primary sources, and utilizing Roman military manuals, Evan Schultheis offers a completely new tactical analysis of the battle and a drastic reconsideration of Hun warfare, the Roman use of federates, and the ethnography of the Germanic peoples who fought for either side. The result is a fresh and thorough case study of battle in the fifth century. Includes maps and illustrations",246,History,en,9781526745668,maurice strategikon
Roman Identity from the Arab Conquests to the Triumph of Orthodoxy,Douglas Whalin,Springer Nature,2021-01-22,"This book asks how the inhabitants and neighbours of the Eastern Roman Empire understand their identity as Romans in the centuries following the emergence of Islam as a world-religion. Its answers lie in exploring the nature of change and continuity of social structures, self-representation, and boundaries as markers of belonging to the Roman group in the period from circa AD 650 to 850. Early medieval Romanness was integral to the Roman imperial project; its local utility as an identifier was shaped by a given community’s relationship with Constantinople, the capital of the Roman state. This volume argues that there was fundamental continuity of Roman identity from Late Antiquity through these centuries into later periods. Many transformations which are ascribed to the Romans of this era have been subjectively assigned by outsiders, separated by time or space, and are not born out by the sources. This finding dovetails with other recent historical works re-evaluating the early medieval Eastern Roman polity and its ideology.",323,History,en,9783030609061,maurice strategikon

Private Households and Public Politics in 3rd-5th Century Jewish Palestine,Alexei Sivertsev,Mohr Siebeck,2002,"Alexei Sivertsev examines the nature of the Jewish aristocratic households and their public functions during the later Roman and Byzantine periods (third to fifth centuries C.E.). The author first discusses the nature of the Jewish patriarchate during the third century C.E. He argues that the family of patriarchs ( nesi'im ) is best understood as a local city-based aristocratic clan. It emerged, along with other contemporary clans, as a result of the gradual conversion of the national aristocracy of the once independent Judean state into the municipal aristocracy of the Roman province of Palaestina in the course of the first to second centuries C.E.In the second part of this book Alexei Sivertsev addresses the specific public functions performed by Jewish aristocratic clans, such as judicial, religious, administrative and legislative. He also demonstrates the continuity that existed in this respect between the Second Commonwealth aristocratic clans and those of the rabbinic period. Finally, the third part of this study deals with the process leading to the integration of the local native aristocracies of the Roman Near East into the centralized administrative system created by the Emperors, starting with Constantine the Great. This process is analyzed specifically regarding the example of the Jewish ruling elite. The main question in this section is the degree to which the local administrative apparatus of the newly created Byzantine bureaucracy developed out of the traditional and clan-based public institutions which had existed locally throughout the Roman period.",304,History,en,3161477804,byzantine empire 5th century

M. Velichko ""History of the Byzantine Emperors"" reveals the events of the reign of all monarchical dynasties of the Holy Roman (Byzantine) Empire – from St. Constantine the Great before the fall of Constantinople in 1453. This is the first comprehensive study in which historical events from the political life of the Byzantine state are depicted in their organic relationship with the life of the ancient Church and the personality of specific kings. The work describes in detail and in detail the most interesting vicissitudes of the history of the Byzantine state, including in terms of interchurch relations between Rome and Constantinople. Numerous events of the times of the Ecumenical Councils are cited, the role and forms of participation of emperors in the activities of the Catholic Church are revealed. The work is supplied with portraits of all the emperors of the Byzantine Empire, maps and extensive reference material. /// For all those interested in the history of Byzantium, the Church, law and politics, as well as students of law and history faculties. /// This volume covers the era from Constantine the Great to Anastasius I. /// ... /// By the example of Byzantium, as reincarnated in Christ and through Christ of the pagan Roman Empire, the Lord revealed such an ideal that would be able to overshadow the pagan Roman analogue, striking in its appearance the minds of his contemporaries. Christ gave not only the ideal of personal faith on the example of the exploits of the first martyrs, ascetics, and saints. He bestowed (by man himself such an ideal, naturally, could neither be conceived nor created) to us a political (sometimes they say – social) ideal, as a special political and legal type of state system, in which the goals and objectives of the earthly Church organically become the alpha and omega public policy ... In other words, the Savior indicated under what state structure the most favorable conditions for the “capture of men” and the regeneration of the old man into the son of God are formed for the Church. /// The practical embodiment of the Kingdom of God on earth in the person of the Empire is the quintessence of Byzantinism, the meaning of life and existence of Byzantium as the first Orthodox state. Hence, as a result, all other legal and social structures are generated that create a stable political, legal and cultural image of an ideal state. /// The main idea of the political and legal system of the Roman (Byzantine) Empire was the imposition of the law of the Church on the state, the well-known identification of the tasks of the Church and the state, and the churching of man. ""The Church in Byzantium just aspired to express itself in the state, to make its law the law of the state. "" For Byzantium, “the existence in a state with civil and political rights of such persons to whom the law of the Church did not apply, and for whom non-observance of church law was not combined with civil and political lawlessness” was a complete absurdity, an unthinkable situation.",478,History,en,,byzantine empire 5th century
"Christian Chronicles and Byzantine History, 5th-6th Centuries",Brian Croke,Variorum Publishing,1992,"This book reflects a preoccupation with analysing the early Byzantine chronicles, above all the very different works of Marcellinus and Malalas, both as historiographical artefacts and as testimony for the years they cover. Many of the studies here demonstrate that, when set in context, even the briefest chronicle entry may shed new light on some aspect of early Byzantine politics, topography or prosopography. Particular themes are the development of the Christian chronicle as a form of presenting the past, the ceremonial life of Constantinople, and the relations between the Roman government and the tribes invading the Balkans.Cet ouvrage traduit une préoccupation certaine se rapportant à l'analyse des chroniques byzantines et surtout des travaux bien différents de Marcellin et de Malalas; l'un et l'autre en tant au'artefacts historiographiques et que témoignages des années qui y sont couvertes.

The Story of the Byzantine Empire,"Charles William Chadwick Oman, M.a., M a F S a Oman, Charles",Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2017-03-07,"The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both ""Byzantine Empire"" and ""Eastern Roman Empire"" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire and to themselves as ""Romans"". Several signal events from the 4th to 6th centuries mark the period of transition during which the Roman Empire's Greek East and Latin West divided. Constantine I (r. 324-337) reorganised the empire, made Constantinople the new capital, and legalised Christianity. Under Theodosius I (r. 379-395), Christianity became the Empire's official state religion and other religious practices were proscribed. Finally, under the reign of Heraclius (r. 610-641), the Empire's military and administration were restructured and adopted Greek for official use instead of Latin. Thus, although the Roman state continued and Roman state traditions were maintained, modern historians distinguish Byzantium from ancient Rome insofar as it was centred on Constantinople, oriented towards Greek rather than Latin culture, and characterised by Orthodox Christianity. The borders of the Empire evolved significantly over its existence, as it went through several cycles of decline and recovery. During the reign of Justinian I (r. 527-565), the Empire reached its greatest extent after reconquering much of the historically Roman western Mediterranean coast, including North Africa, Italy, and Rome itself, which it held for two more centuries. During the reign of Maurice (r. 582-602), the Empire's eastern frontier was expanded and the north stabilised. However, his assassination caused the Byzantine-Sasanian War of 602-628, which exhausted the Empire's resources and contributed to major territorial losses during the Muslim conquests of the seventh century. In a matter of years the Empire lost its richest provinces, Egypt and Syria, to the Arabs. During the Macedonian dynasty (10th-11th centuries), the Empire again expanded and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance, which came to an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. This battle opened the way for the Turks to settle in Anatolia. The Empire recovered again during the Komnenian restoration, such that by the 12th century Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest European city. However, it was delivered a mortal blow during the Fourth Crusade, when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 and the territories that the Empire formerly governed were divided into competing Byzantine Greek and Latin realms. Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire remained only one of several small rival states in the area for the final two centuries of its existence. Its remaining territories were progressively annexed by the Ottomans over the 15th century. The Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453 finally ended the Byzantine Empire.",384,,en,1544218524,byzantine empire 5th century

East of the Theater Glassware and Glass Production,Anastassios C. Antonaras,American School of Classical Studies at Athens,2023-01-13,"Corinth has been an important site for the study of ancient glass since the pioneering work of Gladys Davidson Weinberg. This volume presents the first attempt at Corinth to analyze the entire corpus of glass found in a single area, that located just east of the Theater, the focus of excavations conducted by the American School of Classical Studies in the 1980s. These excavations revealed a north-south street that flanked the Theater, as well as a series of buildings to its east, part of a residential neighborhood ranging in date from the Early Roman to the Early Byzantine period. In this volume-the first of the final reports from the East of Theater excavations-the author presents the glass finds, including over 450 cataloged examples of glassworking remains, vessel glass, and non-vessel glass. Significantly, these finds reveal shifting patterns in vessel types, manufacturing techniques, and trade, as well as evidence for local glass production throughout these periods. Included among the finds are fragments of two opus sectile panels, evidence of the type of luxurious decoration that once existed in these structures. This groundbreaking study provides a tantalizing glimpse into the lives of everyday Corinthians, advancing glass studies both within Greece and throughout the Mediterranean.",241,History,en,9781621390435,byzantine empire 5th century
Roman Empire Decline,"Amelia Khatri, AI",Publifye AS,2025-01-30,"""""Roman Empire Decline"""" offers a compelling examination of history's most powerful empire's dissolution, methodically analyzing the complex factors that led to Rome's fall in 476 CE. The book uniquely weaves together three critical elements: political instability during the Crisis of the Third Century, severe economic deterioration, and mounting external pressures from Germanic tribes and Persian forces. Through a careful examination of archaeological evidence and contemporary accounts, including writings from historians Tacitus and Ammianus Marcellinus, the text reveals how these forces worked in concert to undermine the empire's foundations. The narrative progresses chronologically from the Severan dynasty through the deposition of Romulus Augustulus, with particular focus on the tumultuous third through fifth centuries CE. During this period, the empire witnessed unprecedented challenges, including the reign of 26 different emperors in just 49 years, widespread currency debasement, and evolving relationships with neighboring peoples. Rather than presenting a simplified fall-from-grace narrative, the book offers a nuanced analysis of how complex diplomatic relationships, military engagements, and cultural exchanges shaped the empire's trajectory. Drawing parallels between ancient Rome and modern nation-states, the book presents fresh perspectives on long-debated topics while maintaining scholarly rigor and accessibility. It challenges readers to consider broader patterns in state governance and economic systems, making the material relevant to contemporary discussions of political and economic sustainability. The analysis incorporates recent archaeological findings from across Europe and the Mediterranean, providing new insights into this pivotal period of world history.",104,History,en,9788233980108,western roman empire collapse

The Roman Empire Uncovered Secrets of a Superpower,Rogan Fish,Freegulls Publishing House,,"The Roman Empire, one of history's most influential superpowers, traces its origins to a blend of myth, legend, and historical reality. Understanding the foundations of Rome requires examining the myths surrounding its birth, its early expansion as a republic, and the eventual transformation into a dominant empire. These formative stages laid the groundwork for centuries of imperial dominance, establishing Rome as a cultural and political epicenter. The story of Rome's foundation begins with the legendary tale of Romulus and Remus. According to Roman mythology, the twin brothers were abandoned by the river Tiber, only to be rescued and nurtured by a she-wolf. Eventually, Romulus would go on to establish the city on Palatine Hill in 753 BCE, becoming its first king after a violent dispute with Remus. Though historians debate the factual accuracy of this tale, it symbolizes Rome’s resilience and its origins rooted in struggle and survival. This myth, coupled with archaeological evidence from early settlements on the hills of Rome, provides insight into how Romans viewed their beginnings as both divine and destined for greatness. Following its legendary foundation, Rome gradually transformed from a small settlement into a robust city-state. Initially, it was ruled by a series of kings who laid the foundations of Roman society, including political and religious institutions. However, the overthrow of the monarchy in 509 BCE marked the beginning of the Roman Republic, a period characterized by shared power between elected officials and a complex system of checks and balances. The Republic's political structure, with the Senate as a central governing body, reflected a commitment to preventing any single ruler from holding excessive power. This early model of governance would profoundly influence later empires and modern political systems.",60,History,en,,western roman empire collapse
If Indo-Europeans survive contemporary global crisis?,Bogdan Góralski,Bogdan Góralski,2021-05-03,"The cosmos, and with it the solar system, through its physical interaction, shapes the fate of the inhabitants of the Earth and their civilization. I have described this in my publications available on OPEN ACCESS on the Internet, and in the following book, I confirm it once again. Physico-chemical processes (including climatic processes) of our planet's environment are controlled by the closer and further influence of the space environment. The changing physicochemical environments (including climate changes) of our planet influencing biological creatures to shape the evolving culture of human civilizations. The defective view of the world promoted in the era of exposing the biological of the human mind contained in the statement ""being shapes consciousness"" is supplemented by ""And consciousness shapes being"". The evolution of human knowledge, supported recently by information resources stored on the Internet, allows us to conclude that the universe is filled with a life shaped by the cosmos, and in response, the evolution of biological life shapes the cosmic environment. This sentence: ""being shapes consciousness and consciousness shapes being"" contains my concept of the functioning of the constantly renewing cosmic environment in which the evolution of biological beings is inscribed. The end of the evolution of biological beings is the creation of a virtual environment in which a new star system will be created, giving life to a virtual biological environment so that energy can be reproduced. The world is composed of interpenetrating and interacting parallel virtual realities that create the energy resources of the Universe. In the first part of the book entitled The Solar System shapes the climate of the Earth’…7 , I describe how the interactions of the Solar System and the Milky Way shape the Earth's climate and the Earth's lithosphere. In the second part of the book entitled The civilization results of climate change…120, I describe how climate change is shaping Earth's cultural systems as human knowledge unfolds. It is necessary to return to the knowledge and beliefs of antiquity to understand the modern world and reconcile different nations. Only peace and reconciliation between people are capable of ensuring the further fruitful evolution of the world. In the last third part of the book entitled The Third Way between capitalism and communism…389, I described the actions that need to be taken for the human world to turn into a harmonious environment enabling the realization of the goal of our evolution - restoring the energy that gave us life, i.e. recreating the virtual solar system and life in it.

Procesy fizyko-chemiczne (a w tym również procesy klimatyczne) środowiska naszej planety są sterowane przez bliższe i dalsze oddziaływanie środowiska kosmicznego. Zmienne środowiska fizyko-chemiczne ( a w tym zmiany klimatu) naszej planety oddziałując na istoty biologiczne kształtuje ewoluującą kulturę min. ludzkich cywilizacji. Wadliwy pogląd na świat lansowany w epoce eksponowania znaczenia biologicznego umysłu ludzkiego zawarty w twierdzeniu „byt kształtuje świadomość” uzupełniam dopełnieniem „a świadomość kształtuje byt”. Ewolucja ludzkiej wiedzy, wspomagana ostatnio przez zasoby informacji zgromadzone w Internecie pozwala stwierdzić, że Wszechświat jest wypełniony życiem kształtowanym przez Kosmos, a w odpowiedzi ewolucja życia biologicznego kształtuje środowisko kosmiczne. W tym zdaniu: „byt kształtuje świadomość a świadomość kształtuje byt” zawarta jest moja koncepcja funkcjonowania ciągle odnawiającego się środowiska kosmicznego w które jest wpisana ewolucja biologicznych istot. Finałem ewolucji biologicznych istot jest stworzenie środowiska wirtualnego w którym powstanie nowy system gwiazdowy dający życie wirtualnemu środowisku biologicznemu po to by energia mogła się odtwarzać. Świat jest złożony z przenikających się i oddziałujących na siebie równoległych wirtualnych rzeczywistości tworzących zasoby energetyczne Wszechświata.

The Roman Empire Fall of the West; Survival of the East,James F Morgan,Author House,2012-12-28,"The Western Roman Empire collapsed more than 1500 years ago, while the Eastern Roman Empire survived for almost a thousand more years. When the west collapsed, no one questioned why. It was simply the way things were. Than about 500 years ago scholars begin to question just why the west should fail and the east survive. A long list of reasons have been presented, but they are seen as contributors to the fall, and were not the primary cause. The Roman Empire was a military nation that was built by the sword. She was also a nation with many internal conflicts. There is a tendency to examine Roman history from the sword, the turmoil, and the many internal conflicts, but Rome was also an agricultural nation built by the plow and the sickle. When we take a close look at just how agriculture was managed, or in many cases mismanaged, it becomes all to obvious why the Western Roman Empire collapsed so quickly, and why the Eastern Roman Empire endured for a millennium.",228,History,en,9781477293171,western roman empire collapse
"The Fall of the Western Roman Empire Archaeology, History and the Decline of Rome",Neil Christie,Bloomsbury Academic,2012-02-15,"There are possibly more explanations for the fall of the Roman Empire than for any other event in history: from the theory that links the widespread use of lead in utensils and glass with mental impairment (and hence incapacity for rule) to the sequoia tree theory, which purports to show through reduced ring growth in these ancient trees how the period coinciding with the fall of empire was one of hardship and death. The more bizarre theories are entertaining but devoid of explanatory power. The question still remains: why did the empire fall? As Christie suggests, the question is misconceived, for rather than collapse there was in the west a process of transformation and in the east the empire continued, scarcely less 'Roman' than before even though Rome itself was not a component. One of the distinctive features of Christie's book is the interplay he allows between history and archaeology, showing the reader the kinds of theme best illuminated by textual evidence and those where developments in archaeology have proved more fruitful.",224,History,en,0340759666,western roman empire collapse

Within this period of about a human lifetime, the concepts of Rome and Romanitas were reshaped and used for various ideological causes. This monograph unfolds through a selection of sources that represent the patterns and diversity of this ideological process. The theme of Rome as a personified and anthropomorphic figure and as an epitomized notion 'applied' on the urban landscape would become part of the identity of the Romans of Rome highlighting a sense of cultural uniqueness in an era when their city’s privileged status was challenged. Towards the end of the chronological limits set in this thesis various versions of Romanitas would emerge indicating new physical and spiritual potentials.",226,History,en,9781040792681,romanitas

Ten Great Ideas from First Corinthians A Leader's Guide to Renewing Your Church,"George Renner, Mark Shaw",Wipf and Stock Publishers,2021-10-19,"First Corinthians is one of the most relevant NT documents for both younger churches seeking maturity in the majority world and older churches seeking renewal in the Western world in the twenty-first century. The reason this epistle is so relevant is that it focuses on renewing the church through believing and living out the good news that because of Jesus’s death and resurrection God has begun his new creation agenda amid the broken world of today. This is not just another commentary (there are many very good ones) but rather we present a biblical theology of church renewal, based on solid exegesis, and our experience as teachers and pastors in both Africa and North America. This book will pull out the essential teaching of Paul on renewal in ten manageable principles, or “great ideas.” Church renewal is not just following certain steps but results from nurturing a culture that practices both cross power and a life of new creation hope. When churches make the shift from traditionalism to radical community and evangelical activism through a new experience of the gospel seen as both personal liberation and the transformation of all things, the church begins to move, and the world begins to change.",257,Religion,en,9781725286856,romanitas
Transformations of Romanness Early Medieval Regions and Identities,"Walter Pohl, Clemens Gantner, Cinzia Grifoni, Marianne Pollheimer-Mohaupt",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2018-07-09,"Roman identity is one of the most interesting cases of social identity because in the course of time, it could mean so many different things: for instance, Greek-speaking subjects of the Byzantine empire, inhabitants of the city of Rome, autonomous civic or regional groups, Latin speakers under ‘barbarian’ rule in the West or, increasingly, representatives of the Church of Rome. Eventually, the Christian dimension of Roman identity gained ground. The shifting concepts of Romanness represent a methodological challenge for studies of ethnicity because, depending on its uses, Roman identity may be regarded as ‘ethnic’ in a broad sense, but under most criteria, it is not. Romanness is indeed a test case how an established and prestigious social identity can acquire many different shades of meaning, which we would class as civic, political, imperial, ethnic, cultural, legal, religious, regional or as status groups. This book offers comprehensive overviews of the meaning of Romanness in most (former) Roman provinces, complemented by a number of comparative and thematic studies.

In this essay, various sources about the first emperor of the Roman Empire will be examined, such as those of Augustus himself, of contemporary or later historians, and archaeological evidence. Generally, it can be stated that Augustus rather used the Republican system including all its traditional positions and regulations to gain power, whereas Caesar opposed the traditional ways of political life and therewith made himself the enemy of the state.

Texts and Identities in the Early Middle Ages,Richard Corradini,Austrian Academy of Sciences Press,2006,"For seven years, a collaboration between the Institute for Medieval Studies of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Universities of Utrecht, Cambridge, Leeds and Paris I, Sorbonne provided the opportunity for young researchers to discuss and coordinate their work. The title of the project and of this volume, Texts and identities, provides the framework for case studies in different fields of early medieval history. They include apparently disparate topics such as historiography and hagiography, monastic spaces and memories, lay and ecclesiastic legislation, as well as liturgy and penance. Rather than defining a common field of research, the meetings from which these papers have emerged derived their coherence from their common methodological framework. This approach combines two elements: on the one hand, emphasis has been laid on the careful analysis of the transmission of texts and of the manuscript evidence; on the other, research has focused on the problem of identity, or rather, of processes of identification, including the perception of differences between specific social, political and religious communities. In the combination of these two approaches the extant texts from the early medieval period are not only seen as mere reflections of ethnic, social and cultural identities, but also as media that gave meaning to social practices and were often intended to inspire, guide, change or prevent action, directly or indirectly. The written texts that have been transmitted to us can be seen as part of a cultural effort to shape the present by means of restructuring the past. The often discordant voices of medieval authors allow modern historians to grasp something of the multiplicity of the early medieval world, and of the disagreements, conflicts, idiosyncrasies and individual perceptions among the people who lived in that period. Many contributions in this volume propose specific methods for studying changing identities. They analyse differences between similar texts over time, or, specifically, changes in texts in the course of their transmission. The papers collected in this volume illustrate that texts were integral parts of a world in transformation.",468,History,en,3700137478,transformation of the roman world

Integration und Herrschaft ethnische Identitäten und soziale Organisation im Frühmittelalter,"Walter Pohl, Max Diesenberger",Austrian Academy of Sciences Press,2002,"Der Band untersucht die Integration von Barbaren in der spatromischen Welt im Zusammenhang mit den spatantiken und fruhmittelalterlichen Formen gesellschaftlicher Integration insgesamt. Im Zentrum stehen dabei der Aufbau neuer Herrschaften auf dem Boden des Imperium Romanum und daruber hinaus und die ethnische Integration, der die romisch-barbarischen Regna ihren Zusammenhalt verdanken. Gerade der weite Horizont der versammelten Arbeiten macht die Bedeutung des Bandes aus. Fruhmittelalterforscher aus neun Landern decken einen Bereich ab, der uber das westromisch-frankische Europa zum byzantinischen und slawischen Osten und ins islamische Spanien reicht. Ebenso vielfaltig sind die Forschungsansatze, wobei die Wiener Forschungstradition der ""Wiener Schule"" der Fruhmittelalterforschung entscheidende Impulse geben konnte. Mehrere Beitrage weisen nach, dass die antiken Formen sozialer und politischer Integration im 5. - 6. Jahrhundert im Westen sowie im Osten auf sehr ahnliche Weise im Wandel waren. Identitatsbildung zwischen Fremdwahrnehmung und Selbstdarstellung wird vor allem anhand der Franken aus mehreren Blickwinkeln neu gedeutet. Untersucht und differenziert wird die Rolle der Kirche bei der Integration der neuen Gentes und Regna. Das Verhaltnis von Siedlungsvorgangen und ethnischen Prozessen wird aus archaologischer wie historischer Sicht problematisiert. Rolle und Selbstdarstellung des Konigtums bei Goten, Alemannen und Franken werden eingehend untersucht, wobei auch die Rolle der Historiographie kritisch hinterfragt wird. Neue Einsichten gibt es insgesamt zu den kulturellen Grundlagen der ethnischen und sozialen Integration, wobei immer wieder die Aneignung und Deutung der Vergangenheit eine Rolle spielt.

"Armies of Dark Ages Europe, 613-987 Charlemagne, the Carolingians and their Enemies",Gabriele Esposito,Pen and Sword Military,2024-11-30,"The centuries that followed the fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD 476 saw the formation of numerous Romano-Germanic kingdoms from the fusion between different Germanic communities and the Roman population. In time the Frankish Kingdom came to dominate over all the others and conquered most of continental Europe under the guidance of the famous Carolingian royal family. In the book we will follow the military ascendancy of the warlike Franks from 613 to 987. The greatest protagonist of this bloody period was Charlemagne, probably the greatest military commander of the Early Middle Ages. He transformed the Frankish kingdom into a large state – the Holy Roman Empire – that dominated most of continental Western Europe for almost a century. Charlemagne spent his long reign (768-814) fighting against a multitude of warlike enemies who lived on the frontiers of his dominions: Arabs, Basques, Bretons, Frisians, Vikings, Saxons, Thuringians, Slavs, Avars, Bavarians and Lombards. He obtained some spectacular victories over the latter, but also suffered some humiliating defeats like the famous one of Roncevaux Pass. Gabriele Esposito follows the evolution of the Frankish Army from the rise of the Franks’ under the Merovingian monarchs to the dissolution of the Carolingian royal family, reconstructing the most important military campaigns in detail. All the major troop types are covered, providing information on the organization and equipment of each contingent. The enemies of the Franks are also considered. The clear text is illustrated with dozens of stunning color photographs depicting replica weapons and equipment of the period in use.",209,History,en,9781399031950,romano-germanic kingdoms
"Empires of Faith The Fall of Rome to the Rise of Islam, 500-700",Peter Sarris,OUP Oxford,2011-10-27,"Drawing upon the latest historical and archaeological research, Dr Peter Sarris provides a panoramic account of the history of Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East from the fall of Rome to the rise of Islam. The formation of a new social and economic order in western Europe in the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries, and the ascendancy across the West of a new culture of military lordship, are placed firmly in the context of on-going connections and influence radiating outwards from the surviving Eastern Roman Empire, ruled from the great imperial capital of Constantinople. The East Roman (or 'Byzantine') Emperor Justinian's attempts to revive imperial fortunes, restore the empire's power in the West, and face down Constantinople's great superpower rival, the Sasanian Empire of Persia, are charted, as too are the ways in which the escalating warfare between Rome and Persia paved the way for the development of new concepts of 'holy war', the emergence of Islam, and the Arab conquests of the Near East. Processes of religious and cultural change are explained through examination of social, economic, and military upheavals, and the formation of early medieval European society is placed in a broader context of changes that swept across the world of Eurasia from Manchuria to the Rhine. Warfare and plague, holy men and kings, emperors, shahs, caliphs, and peasants all play their part in a compelling narrative suited to specialist, student, and general readership alike.",861,History,en,9780191620027,romano-germanic kingdoms
"Framing the Early Middle Ages Europe and the Mediterranean, 400-800",Chris Wickham,OUP Oxford,2006-11-30,"The Roman empire tends to be seen as a whole whereas the early middle ages tends to be seen as a collection of regional histories, roughly corresponding to the land-areas of modern nation states. As a result, early medieval history is much more fragmented, and there have been few convincing syntheses of socio-economic change in the post-Roman world since the 1930s. In recent decades, the rise of early medieval archaeology has also transformed our source-base, but this has not been adequately integrated into analyses of documentary history in almost any country. In Framing the Early Middle Ages Chris Wickham combines documentary and archaeological evidence to create a comparative history of the period 400-800. His analysis embraces each of the regions of the late Roman and immediately post-Roman world, from Denmark to Egypt. The book concentrates on classic socio-economic themes, state finance, the wealth and identity of the aristocracy, estate management, peasant society, rural settlement, cities, and exchange. These give only a partial picture of the period, but they frame and explain other developments. Earlier syntheses have taken the development of a single region as 'typical', with divergent developments presented as exceptions. This book takes all different developments as typical, and aims to construct a synthesis based on a better understanding of difference and the reasons for it.",1125,History,en,9780191622632,romano-germanic kingdoms

Norms of Dependency in Late Antique and Early Medieval Societies Contextualising Roman Legal Terminology,"Martin Schermaier, Julia Winnebeck, Matthias Becher",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2025-06-02,"Late antique and early medieval normative sources frequently employ Roman legal terminology to denote a person’s legal inferiority, and thus suggest the continued relevance of the concepts associated with these terms. However, it is far from clear to what extent the use of identical terminology actually indicates the similarity of social phenomena. There is ample evidence of important changes regarding the rights and duties of enslaved persons and the development or emergence of other, new, forms of asymmetrical dependency. This raises the question to what extent consistency in terminology and legal practice is actually an indicator of the stability of social structures. Against this background, a group of scholars of legal, ecclesiastical, and social history were invited to a conference at the BCDSS in March 2022 to scrutinise different law codes and legal sources for their evidence of dependency. The result are these ten papers that truly enhance our understanding of slavery and other dependency relations in late antique and early medieval societies from c. 100 to c. 900 CE.",313,Social Science,en,9783111663654,post-roman
Viking and Ecclesiastical Interactions in the Irish Sea Area from the 9th to 11th Centuries,Danica Ramsey-Brimberg,Taylor & Francis,2024-05-15,"Different approaches have been conducted to analyse the interactions of the different belief systems in the early medieval world. This book assesses the relationship between clerics and Scandinavian-influenced laity in the Irish Sea area through the placement of furnished graves at or near ecclesiastical sites in the ninth through the eleventh centuries. Other areas of funerary studies have moved beyond a dichotomy of Christianity and paganism, acknowledging that practices can be multifaceted. Yet, statements regarding Viking Age furnished graves in or near ecclesiastical sites are still not as pervasively open to this line of thinking. To bridge this gap, this book delves into the historiography and context of the burial practices through multidisciplinary analysis. The ecclesiastical sites and furnished graves of the eastern (southwest Scotland and northwest England), central (Isle of Man), and western (Ireland and Northern Ireland) Irish Sea areas are then examined using various sources to understand their contexts and relationships. In the final chapters, the sites and graves are brought together to identify any trends, any unique circumstances that led to local variances, and their fit into the larger picture. Viking Age furnished graves can be seen as an acceptable variation among an array of burial practices, and the relationship between the clergy and laity is far more complex and closely tied than has been portrayed. Viking and Ecclesiastical Interactions in the Irish Sea Area from the 9th to 11th Centuries will appeal to students and scholars alike interested in the history of the Vikings in the British-Irish Isles and their relationships with ecclesiastical institutions.",337,History,en,9781040013335,post-roman
Rome and Byzantium in the Visigothic Kingdom Beyond Imitatio Imperii,"Damián Fernández, Molly Lester, Jamie Wood",Taylor & Francis,2025-10-01,"This volume interrogates the assumption that Visigothic practices and institutions were mere imitations of the Byzantine empire. Contributors rethink these practices not as uncritical and derivative adoptions of Byzantine customs, but as dynamic processes in dialogue with not only the Byzantine empire but also with the contemporary Iberian context, as well as the Roman past. The goal of the volume is to approach Visigothic customs not as an uncritical adoption and imitatio of contemporary Roman models (an acculturation model), but as unique interpretations of a common pool of symbols, practices, and institutions that formed the legacy of Rome. The contributors argue that it is necessary to reconsider the idea of imitatio imperii as a process that involved specific actors taking strategic decisions in historically contingent circumstances.",249,History,en,9781040784426,post-roman
"From Coast to Fen: Archaeology in a Dynamic Landscape The Archaeology of the Triton Knoll Electrical System, Lincolnshire","Claire Christie, Joshua T. Hogue",Oxbow Books,2025-07-18,"Excavations across East Lincolnshire reveal prehistoric, Iron Age, Roman, and post-medieval settlements, saltmaking, and industrial activity, shaped by changing landscapes. The area between Anderby Creek and Bicker Fen, Lincolnshire, to the west of the Lincolnshire Wolds, represents a dynamic landscape both in terms of its natural and human aspects. This volume presents the results of an extensive programme of archaeological excavation undertaken by Headland Archaeology (UK) Ltd and Allen Archaeology Ltd from 2018 to 2019, where a total of 15 sites were excavated. The excavations uncovered a panoply of remains spanning the prehistoric through to modern periods, providing important insights into changing patterns of occupation and the way this diverse landscape was utilised. As evidenced through the archaeological works the area saw limited activity during the early prehistoric period, in part reflecting the prevailing environmental conditions in which most of the area was inundated. Among the earliest recorded finds was an enigmatic middle Bronze Age timber structure as well as a copper alloy axe. During the Roman period there is evidence for an expansion in activity across the Scheme, with formerly inundated areas becoming accessible. Activity within the northern half of the Scheme was focused upon salt production. Two of these sites were dated to the late Roman period, contrary to the prevailing notion that the salt industry in this region had declined by the mid-2nd century AD. Within the southern half of the Scheme were several Roman farmsteads, some featuring timber buildings. Notable among these was an unusual post-built, moated structure. From these sites a range of artefactual and environmental data was collected, providing important insights into the nature of agricultural regimes. Evidence of medieval and post-medieval activity was also uncovered, providing important insights into the development of rural settlement against a backdrop of landscape and environmental changes. Evidence of late to post-medieval clay extraction and brick manufacture was also identified.",194,Social Science,en,9798888571965,post-roman

He begins by delving into the historical contexts of the key traditional players of the fifth century--Hengest and Gwrtheyrn. A better understanding of these two characters allows for a reexamination of the persons and events of the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries. The text that follows entirely realigns how those centuries can be seen from a chronological as well as a military and political standpoint. The fifth century was not a time of British and Germanic fragmentation as they separated from Rome, but one of slow integration and the formation of kingships that were a result of the economic realities of surviving without the dying giant.",263,Biography & Autobiography,en,9781476613383,sub-roman britain

"" Warlords"" brings to life a world of ambition, brutality and violence in a politically fragmented land, and provides a compelling new history of an age that would transform Britain. By comparing the archaeology against the available historical sources for the period, "" Warlords"" presents a coherent picture of the political and military machinations of the fifth and sixth centuries that laid the foundations of English and Welsh history. Included are the warring personalities of the local leaders and a look at the enigma of King Arthur. Some warlords sought power within the old Roman framework; some used an alternative British approach; and, others exploited the emerging Anglo-Saxon system - but for all warlords, the struggle was for power.",268,History,en,9780752475608,sub-roman britain

"An Age of Tyrants Britain and the Britons, A.D. 400-600",Christopher A. Snyder,Penn State University Press,1998,"An Age of Tyrants explores an obscure period in the history of the British Isles often referred to as Sub-Roman Britain. Such a label implies that social and cultural decline followed the end of Roman imperial control. But Christopher Snyder shows that Britain developed unique social, political, and religious institutions during this time. Snyder's innovative approach involves analysis of both the written and archaeological record. Looking at contemporary writers such as Patrick and Gildas, he shows how the cultural and political landscape was changing during this period. By the waning years of the Roman Empire, Britain was earning a special reputation as a ""province fertile with tyrants."" These tyrants dominate the historical accounts of the fifth and sixth centuries and tell us much about the transition from magisterial to monarchical power in Britain. Combining this with what we know from archaeology, Snyder reveals a society that was a hybrid of indigenous (Celtic), Mediterranean (Roman), and Christian elements that preceded the coming of the Anglo-Saxons. An appendix explores how Arthur and Merlin fit into this picture. Snyder's other important findings include: * The military arrangements of the Britons owed much to both Roman and Celtic inspiration. * The spread of Christianity (and especially monasticism) after 400 was swift and unhindered by paganism. * The economy of Britain was not completely coinless and, indeed, was seemingly vigorous with the revival of trade with Gaul and the Mediterranean. * The growing cultural antagonism between the Britons and the Saxons would have far-reaching consequences.",432,History,en,,sub-roman britain

Through careful research of the many primary documents, a picture of the true Arthur can in fact be set down. He reached power shortly after the Romans evacuated Britain at the end of the fifth century and died at the Battle of Camlann. He became king at 15 under the name of Ambrosius Aurelianus and fought against the Saxons on the mainland as Riothamus, thus explaining the regeneration motif so closely tied to the mythical Arthur.

Gildas's De Excidio Britonum and the Early British Church,Dr. Karen George,,2009,"A study of a contemporary witness to the transformation of post-Roman Britain into Anglo-Saxon England. Gildas's De excidio Britonum is a rare surviving contemporary source for the period which saw the beginning of the transformation of post-Roman Britain into Anglo-Saxon England. However, although the De excidio has received much scholarly attention over the last forty years, the value of the text as a primary source for this fascinating if obscure period of British history has been limited by our lack of knowledge concerning its historical and cultural context. In this new study the author challenges the assumption that the British Church was isolated from its Continental counterpart by Germanic settlement in Britain and seeks to establish a theological context for the De excidio within the framework of doctrinal controversy in the early Continental Church. The vexed question of the place of Pelagianism in the early British Church is re-investigated and a case is put forward for a radical new interpretation of Gildas's own theological stance. In addition, this study presents a detailed investigation of the literary structure of the De excidio and Gildas's use of verbal patterns, and argues that his use ofthe Bible as a literary model is at least as significant as his well-documented use of the literary techniques of Classical Latin. Dr KAREN GEORGE is currently a tutor at the Cambridge Institute of Continuing Education.",220,History,en,,sub-roman britain

Rural Settlements and Society in Anglo-Saxon England,Helena Hamerow,Oxford University Press,2012-07-05,"In the course of the fifth century, the farms and villas of lowland Britain were replaced by a new, distinctive form of rural settlement: the settlements of the Anglo-Saxons. This volume presents the first major synthesis of the evidence - which has expanded enormously in recent years - for such settlements from across England and throughout the Anglo-Saxon period, and what it reveals about the communities who built and lived in them, and whose daily lives went almost wholly unrecorded. Helena Hamerow examines the appearance, function, and 'life-cycles' of their buildings; the relationship of Anglo-Saxon settlements to the Romano-British landscape and to later medieval villages; the role of ritual in daily life; and the relationship between farming regimes and settlement forms. A central theme throughout the book is the impact on rural producers of the rise of lordship and markets, and how this impact is reflected in the remains of their settlements.

Anglo-Saxons Early English Settlers and Their British Isles,Rolf Hedger,,2025-07-18,"The story of the Anglo-Saxons begins not in the rolling hills of England but across the North Sea, in the windswept marshlands and dense forests of what is now Denmark, northern Germany, and the Netherlands. During the tumultuous centuries following the collapse of Roman authority in Britain around 410 CE, waves of Germanic peoples embarked on one of history's most significant migrations, forever transforming the cultural, linguistic, and political landscape of the British Isles. The term ""Anglo-Saxon"" itself reflects the composite nature of this migration, combining the Angles from the Danish peninsula of Jutland and Schleswig, the Saxons from the coastal regions of northwestern Germany, and the Jutes from the Danish peninsula that still bears their name. These peoples shared similar languages, customs, and social structures, but they were not a unified nation or single ethnic group. Rather, they represented numerous tribes and clans, each with their own leaders, territories, and aspirations, united primarily by their Germanic heritage and their shared decision to seek new lands across the treacherous waters of the North Sea. The reasons for this massive population movement were complex and varied, reflecting both the push factors that made life increasingly difficult in their continental homelands and the pull factors that made Britain an attractive destination. The end of Roman rule had created a power vacuum that invited invasion and settlement, while the withdrawal of Roman legions left the Romanized British population vulnerable and in need of military assistance. Archaeological evidence and written sources suggest that rising sea levels, increasing population pressure, political instability, and the aggressive expansion of Frankish power all contributed to the Germanic peoples' decision to seek new territories.",29,History,en,,anglo-saxon settlement

Frisians of the Early Middle Ages,"John Hines, Nelleke IJssennagger",Boydell & Brewer,2021,"Multi-disciplinary approaches shed fresh light on the Frisian people and their changing cultures. Frisian is a name that came to be identified with one of the territorially expansive, Germanic-speaking peoples of the Early Middle Ages, occupying coastal lands south and south-east of the North Sea. Highly varied manifestations of Frisian-ness can be traced in and around the north-western corner of the European continent in cultural, linguistic, ethnic and political forms across two thousand years to the present day. The thematic studies in this volume foreground how diverse ""Frisians"" in different places and contexts could be. They draw on a range of multi-disciplinary sources and methodologies to explore a comprehensive range of social, economic and ideological aspects of early Frisian culture, from the Dutch province of Zeeland in the south-west to the North Frisian region in the north-east. Chronologically, there is an emphasis on the crucial developments of the seventh and eighth centuries AD, alongside demonstrations of how later evidence can retrospectively clarify long-term processes of group formation.The essays here thus add substantial new evidence to our understanding of a crucial stage in the evolution of an identity which had to develop and adapt to changing influences and pressures.",438,History,en,9781783275618,frisian migration

"Germanic Heritage Languages in North America Acquisition, attrition and change","Janne Bondi Johannessen, Joseph C. Salmons",John Benjamins Publishing Company,2015-08-15,"This book presents new empirical findings about Germanic heritage varieties spoken in North America: Dutch, German, Pennsylvania Dutch, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, West Frisian and Yiddish, and varieties of English spoken both by heritage speakers and in communities after language shift. The volume focuses on three critical issues underlying the notion of ‘heritage language’: acquisition, attrition and change. The book offers theoretically-informed discussions of heritage language processes across phonetics and phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics and the lexicon, in addition to work on sociolinguistics, historical linguistics and contact settings. With this, the volume also includes a variety of frameworks and approaches, synchronic and diachronic. Most European Germanic languages share some central linguistic features, such as V2, gender and agreement in the nominal system, and verb inflection. As minority languages faced with a majority language like English, similarities and differences emerge in patterns of variation and change in these heritage languages.

"The Avars A Steppe Empire in Central Europe, 567–822",Walter Pohl,Cornell University Press,2018-12-15,"""Though the book was first published in German in 1988, this English version includes many revisions and updates and will be the definitive English-language study of the Avar empire for years to come. It will be invaluable for those interested in medieval history or in the impact of nomadic steppe empires on sedentary civilizations."" ― Choice The Avars arrived in Europe from the Central Asian steppes in the mid-sixth century CE and dominated much of Central and Eastern Europe for almost 250 years. Fierce warriors and canny power brokers, the Avars were more influential and durable than Attila's Huns, yet have remained hidden in history. Walter Pohl's epic narrative, translated into English for the first time, restores them to their rightful place in the story of early medieval Europe. The Avars offers a comprehensive overview of their history, tracing the Avars from the construction of their steppe empire in the center of Europe; their wars and alliances with the Byzantines, Slavs, Lombards, and others; their apex as the first so-called barbarian power to besiege Constantinople (in 626); to their fall under the Frankish armies of Charlemagne and subsequent disappearance as a distinct cultural group. Pohl uncovers the secrets of their society, synthesizing the rich archaeological record recovered from more than 60,000 graves of the period, as well as accounts of the Avars by Byzantine and other chroniclers. In recovering the story of the fascinating encounter between Eurasian nomads who established an empire in the heart of Europe and the post-Roman Christian cultures of Europe, this book provides a new perspective on the origins of medieval Europe itself.",663,History,en,9781501729409,slavic expansion
Wallachian Mobility and Settlement along the Carpathian Arc,"Mihai Dragnea, Miloš Marek, Grzegorz Jawor, John Polemikos",Taylor & Francis,2025-02-28,"The story of Wallachian mobility and settlement is remarkably central to the human condition. At its core, it reflects a fundamental drive to enhance daily life by migrating to new territories. The Wallachian features not only shaped their own existence but also left a lasting impact on the regions they inhabited along the Carpathian Arc. Through their migration beginning roughly in the 14th century and culminating in the 18th, they not only became part of a larger narrative of human resilience and adaptability but also reflect humanity’s drive for better opportunity. Wallachian Mobility and Settlement Carpathian Arc, a project initiated by the Balkan History Association, seeks to fill this void by bringing together the research from multinational scholars of various academic disciplines. Scholars and students seeking to further understand the prevailing academic literature on this topic will find this an invaluable, one-of-a-kind resource.

"Engineering Expansion The U.S. Army and Economic Development, 1787-1860",William D. Adler,University of Pennsylvania Press,2021-11-26,"Engineering Expansion examines the U.S. Army's role in U.S. economic development from the nation's founding to the eve of the Civil War. William D. Adler starts with a simple question: if the federal government was weak in its early years, how could the economy and the nation have grown so rapidly? Adler answers this question by focusing on the strongest part of the early American state, the U.S. Army. The Army shaped the American economy through its coercive actions in conquering territory, expanding the nation's borders, and maintaining public order and the rule of law. It built roads, bridges, and railroads while Army engineers and ordnance officers developed new technologies, constructed forts that encouraged western settlement and nurtured nascent communities, cleared rivers, and created manufacturing innovations that spread throughout the private sector. Politicians fought for control of the Army, but War Department bureaucracies also contributed to their own development by shaping the preferences of elected officials.

Reconstructing Non-Standard Languages A socially-anchored approach,"Lenore A.

In-depth analyses of Odessan Russian, a southern Russian contact variety with Yiddish and Ukrainian elements, and Russian lexifier pidgins illustrate the reconstruction process, which involves making the most of all available documentation, particularly literature and stereotypical descriptions. Historical sociolinguistics of this kind straddles the fields of historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and contact; this book brings together the methods and theories of these areas to show how they can result in a rich reconstruction of linguistic and socially-conditioned variation. We reconstruct the circumstances and social settings that produced this variation, and demonstrate how to reconstruct which variants were used by different types of speakers under different circumstances, and what kinds of social identities they indexed.",372,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,9789027257345,slavic expansion
Origins of the Slavs,"Amelia Khatri, AI",Publifye AS,2025-02-12,"""""Origins of the Slavs"""" delves into the complex history of Slavic peoples, tracing their journey from obscure origins to distinct cultural and political entities. It investigates the contested Proto-Slavic homeland theories, analyzing archaeological and linguistic evidence to locate the area where Slavic languages and cultures emerged. Furthermore, the book meticulously reconstructs Slavic migrations across Europe, examining the driving forces behind these population shifts. Understanding this formative period offers crucial insights into modern Eastern Europe's geopolitical landscape and cultural heritage. The book challenges traditional narratives by arguing that Slavic identity wasn't static but evolved dynamically through interactions and cultural adaptations. It highlights the impact of Germanic, Iranian, and Byzantine civilizations on shaping early Slavic societies. For example, the adoption of Christianity significantly altered Slavic religious beliefs and social structures. """"Origins of the Slavs"""" draws upon diverse evidence like archaeological finds, linguistic analysis, and historical accounts to provide a comprehensive view. Beginning with the primary sources and methodologies, the book then explores Proto-Slavic homeland theories and details migration waves.

The Teutonic Knights Strike East The 14th Century Crusades in Lithuania and Rus',"William Urban, Darius Baronas",Greenhill Books,2024-08-30,"Written by two leading experts on the Crusades in an enjoyable and compelling style, this is an accessible narrative of a complex political and military history. The history of the Teutonic Knights is one of crusading in an era of wars, intrigues, assassinations and betrayals. Originally established as a hospital order during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in the late 12th century, the order evolved into a formidable military force dedicated to defending and expanding Christianity in the Baltic region. This book explores the crusade aimed at Lithuanian pagans in the Middle Ages, when crusaders from the Holy Roman Empire, France, England and Scotland came to Prussia to fight alongside the Teutonic Knights. What ensued was a long-drawn out, many-sided struggle, with Lithuania and Poland first becoming powerful states, then expanding into Belarus and Ukraine, where the Mongols and Tatars had long held sway.

"Armies of the Steppe Nomads, 376–1227 from the Coming of Attila's Huns to the Death of Genghis, Great Khan of the Mongols",Gabriele Esposito,Pen and Sword Military,2024-12-30,"Gabriele Esposito presents an overview of the history, organization and equipment of the military forces deployed by the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes during the period from the appearance of the Huns in Eastern Europe to the death of Genghis Khan. Each chapter is devoted to a different group that played a prominent military role during Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Starting with the Huns of Attila, whose migration was one of the key factors behind the fall of the Roman Empire, he moves on to the Avars, who established a large state in Eastern Europe that contested with Charlemagne’s Frankish Empire. Chapter three covers the Magyars, who terrorized most of Europe during the tenth century before creating the Kingdom of Hungary. Next are the Bulgars, who became the worst enemies of the Byzantine Empire in the Balkans but also created a flourishing state in the Volga region of Russia. The Khazars and the Alans share a chapter, as do the Pechenegs and Cumans-Kipchaks, while the Turks merit a dedicated chapter. Last but not least are the Mongols, who are traced from the unification of their tribes to the death of the great Genghis Khan. By describing the military organization, weapons and tactics of these nomadic peoples the author shows how they dominated the battlefields of the world for almost 1,000 years thanks to their superior capabilities. He also discusses how they interacted with other civilizations and how the latter learned a lot from them, especially militarily. Without the existence of the warlike nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes, the history of the world would have been very different.",234,History,en,9781399037815,avar khaganate

Sources pertaining to the lives of Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius, as well as those for the study of Moravia, had been subjected to unwarranted interpretations or emendations, other sources of significance had been entirely omitted from considera tion, and finally, crucial formulations concerning Cyril and Methodius and Moravian history had been made in recent historiography without any basis in sources.

The Early Medieval World: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne addresses the social and material culture of this critical period in the evolution of Western society, covering the social, political, cultural, and religious history of the Mediterranean world and northern Europe. The two-volume set explains how invading and migrating barbarian tribes—spurred by raiding Huns from the steppes of Central Asia—contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and documents how the blending of Greco-Roman, Germanic, and Christian cultures birthed a new civilization in Western Europe, creating the Christian Church and the modern nation-state. A-Z entries discuss political transformation, changing religious practices in daily life, sculpture and the arts, material culture, and social structure, and provide biographies of important men and women in the transitional period of late antiquity. The work will be extremely helpful to students learning about the factors that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire—an important and common topic in world history curricula.",613,History,en,9798216076803,lombard italy
Augustine Through the Ages An Encyclopedia,"Allan Fitzgerald, John C. Cavadini",Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing,1999,"This one-volume reference work provides the first encyclopedic treatment of the life, thought, and influence of Augustine of Hippo (A.D. 354-430), one of the greatest figures in the history of the Christian church. The product of more than 140 leading scholars throughout the world, this comprehensive encyclopedia contains over 400 articles that cover every aspect of Augustine's life and writings and trace his profound influence on the church and the development of Western thought through the past two millennia. Major articles examine in detail all of Augustine's nearly 120 extant writings, from his brief tractates to his prodigious theological works. For many readers, this volume is the only source for commentary on the numerous works by Augustine not available in English. Other articles discuss: Augustine's influence on other theologians, from contemporaries like Jerome and Ambrose to prominent figures throughout church history, such as Gregory the Great, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Harnack; Augustine's life, the chaotic political events of his world, and the church's struggles with such heresies as Arianism, Donatism, Manicheism, and Pelagianism; Augustine's thoughts about philosophical problems (time, the ascent of the soul, the nature of truth), theological questions (guilt, original sin, free will, the Trinity), and cultural issues (church-state relations, Roman society).",962,Biography & Autobiography,en,080283843X,cassiodorus
The Routledge Handbook on Identity in Byzantium,"Michael Stewart, David Parnell, Conor Whately",Routledge,2022-03-30,"This volume is the first to focus solely on how specific individuals and groups in Byzantium and its borderlands were defined and distinguished from other individuals and groups from the mid-fourth to the close of the fifteenth century. It gathers chapters from both established and emerging scholars from a wide range of disciplines across history, art, archaeology, and religion to provide an accurate representation of the state of the field both now and in its immediate future. The handbook is divided into four subtopics that examine concepts of group and specific individual identity which have been chosen to provide methodologically sophisticated and multidisciplinary perspectives on specific categories of group and individual identity. The topics are Imperial Identities; Romanitas in the Late Antique Mediterranean; Macro and Micro Identities: Religious, Regional, and Ethnic Identities, and Internal Others; and Gendered Identities: Literature, Memory, and Self in Early and Middle Byzantium. While no single volume could ever provide a comprehensive vision of identities on the vast variety of peoples within Byzantium over nearly a millennium of its history, this handbook represents a milestone in offering a survey of the vibrant surge of scholarship examining the numerous and oft-times fluctuating codes of identity that shaped and transformed Byzantium and its neighbours during the empire’s long life.",469,History,en,9780429633409,cassiodorus
Dreams and Visions An Interdisciplinary Enquiry,Nancy van Deusen,BRILL,2010-01-13,"Dreams and Visions have constituted an important topic and point of departure in the past; but also continue to play a present role in literature, political thought, economic theory, and in the arts.

"Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths Studies in a Migration Myth",Arne Søby Christensen,Museum Tusculanum Press,2002,"This book is a study in the myth of the origins and early history of the Goths as told in the Getica written by Jordanes in AD 551. Jordanes claimed they emigrated from the island of Scandza (Sweden) in 1490 BC, thus giving them a history of more than two thousand years. He found this narrative in Cassiodorus' Gothic history, which is now lost. The present study demonstrates that Cassiodorus and Jordanes did not base their accounts on a living Gothic tradition of the past, as the Getica would have us believe. On the contrary, they got their information only from the Graeco-Roman literature. The Greeks and Romans, however, did not know of the Goths until the middle of the third century AD. Consequently, Cassiodorus and Jordanes created a Gothic history partly through an erudite exploitation of the names of foreign peoples, and partly by using the narratives about other peoples' history as if they belonged to the Goths. The history of the Migrations therefore must be reconsidered.",408,History,en,8772897104,jordanes
A Companion to Gregory of Tours,Alexander C. Murray,BRILL,2015-11-16,"Gregory, bishop of Tours (573-594), was among the most prolific writers of his age and uniquely managed to cover the genres of history, hagiography, and ecclesiastical instruction. He not only wrote about events (of the secular, spiritual, and even natural variety) but about himself as an actor and witness. Though his work (especially the Histories) has been recycled and studied for centuries, our grasp of an even basic understanding of it, never mind Gregory’s significance in the history of the late antique West, has hardly yet attained a definitive perspective. A Companion to Gregory of Tours brings together fourteen scholars who provide an expert guide to interpreting his works, his period, and his legacy in religious and historical studies.

"History, Frankish Identity and the Framing of Western Ethnicity, 550-850",Helmut Reimitz,Cambridge University Press,2015-08-06,"This pioneering study explores early medieval Frankish identity as a window into the formation of a distinct Western conception of ethnicity. Focusing on the turbulent and varied history of Frankish identity in Merovingian and Carolingian historiography, it offers a new basis for comparing the history of collective and ethnic identity in the Christian West with other contexts, especially the Islamic and Byzantine worlds. The tremendous political success of the Frankish kingdoms provided the medieval West with fundamental political, religious and social structures, including a change from the Roman perspective on ethnicity as the quality of the 'Other' to the Carolingian perception that a variety of Christian peoples were chosen by God to reign over the former Roman provinces. Interpreting identity as an open-ended process, Helmut Reimitz explores the role of Frankish identity in the multiple efforts through which societies tried to find order in the rapidly changing post-Roman world.",529,History,en,9781107032330,gregory of tours

The LI was a manifestation of a vibrant dialectical situation, particularly between two networks of authority, Isidore-Seville and Toledo-Agali, a defining characteristic of the discourse coloring the fabric of writing in Hispania, c. 600-660. To more fully imagine the meaning, significance and purposes of the LI, this book elicits this cooperative competition through a series of four case-studies on writing in the period. In addition to offering an alternative historiography for the LI, this book expands the corpus of “Visigothic Literature” and introduces what the author refers to as “Gothstalgie.” See inside the book.",257,History,en,9789004450011,isidore of seville

Roman Law An Introduction,Rafael Domingo,Routledge,2018-04-17,"Roman Law: An Introduction offers a clear and accessible introduction to Roman law for students of any legal tradition. In the thousand years between the Law of the Twelve Tables and Justinian’s massive Codification, the Romans developed the most sophisticated and comprehensive secular legal system of Antiquity, which remains at the heart of the civil law tradition of Europe, Latin America, and some countries of Asia and Africa. Roman lawyers created new legal concepts, ideas, rules, and mechanisms that most Western legal systems still apply. The study of Roman law thus facilitates understanding among people of different cultures by inspiring a kind of legal common sense and breadth of knowledge. Based on over twenty-five years’ experience teaching Roman law, this volume offers a comprehensive examination of the subject, as well as a historical introduction which contextualizes the Roman legal system for students who have no familiarity with Latin or knowledge of Roman history. More than a compilation of legal facts, the book captures the defining characteristics and principal achievements of Roman legal culture through a millennium of development.",295,History,en,9781351111454,roman law codification

Many university scholars have participated in the contemporary revolution in the description, analysis, and interpretation of the Mishnah. Nearly all the publishing scholars of the academy (as distinct from the yeshiva or rabbinical seminary) who are now at work are represented in this project, ultimately planned for three volumes. In this and the companion volumes, the editors place on display a broad selection of approaches to the study of the Mishnah in the contemporary academy. What they prove in diverse ways is that the Mishnah defines the critical focus of the study of Judaism. It is a document that rewards study in the academic humanities.

This edited collection connects to this debate. Yet, it shifts the focus from the currently predominant public law focus to investigating European and EU private law and to connecting to literature and research on transnational law. To that end, it proceeds first conceptually by introducing and giving shape to the notion of a “European Transnational Private Law” through four conceptual contributions by the editors. Secondly, it focuses on several sectors (finance, taxation, investment, consumer law, labour law) and topics (climate litigation, global value chains, non-discrimination) to trace sector-specifically the role of EU private law in relation to transnational legal ordering.",419,Law,en,9781509962945,roman law codification

Bringing nearly fifty years of research to bear on these fundamental questions, Jacob Neusner challenges his readers to face the difficult, often unasked or neglected questions about the nature, background, and purposes of Rabbinic Judaism and rewards them with an enriched understanding and a stronger foundation for tackling the even more elusive questions concerning the theology of formative Judaism.

Exploiting neglected texts, author Robin Whelan exposes a sophisticated culture of disputation between Nicene (“Catholic”) and Homoian (“Arian”) Christians and explores their rival claims to political and religious legitimacy.

Rome and the Classic Maya Comparing the Slow Collapse of Civilizations,"Rebecca Storey, Glenn R Storey",Taylor & Francis,2017-01-20,"This volume compares two of the most famous cases of civilizational collapse, that of the Roman Empire and the Classic Maya world. First examining the concept of collapse, and how it has been utilized in the historical, archaeological and anthropological study of past complex societies, Storey and Storey draw on extensive archaeological evidence to consider the ultimate failure of the institutions, infrastructure and material culture of both of these complex cultures. Detailing the relevant economic, political, social and environmental factors behind these notable falls, Rome and the Classic Maya contends that a phenomenon of “slow collapse” has repeatedly occurred in the course of human history: complex civilizations are shown to eventually come to an end and give way to new cultures. Through their analysis of these two ancient case studies, the authors also present intriguing parallels to the modern world and offer potential lessons for the future.",293,Social Science,en,9781315309408,roman identity 5th-7th

"Ravenna and the Traditions of Late Antique and Early Byzantine Craftsmanship Labour, Culture, and the Economy",Salvatore Cosentino,Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2020-08-10,"In the last twenty years scholarship on late antique and early medieval Ravenna has resulted in a certain number of publications mainly focused on the fields of architecture, mosaics and archaeology. On the contrary, much less attention has been paid on labour – both manual and intellectual – as well as the structure of production and objects derived from manufacturing activities, despite the fact that Ravenna is the place which preserves the highest number of historical evidence among all centres of the late Roman Mediterranean. Its cultural heritage is vast and composite, ranging from papyri to inscriptions, from ivories to marbles, as well as luxury objects, pottery, and coins. Starting from concrete typologies of hand-manufactured goods existing in the Ravennate milieu, the book aims at exploring the multifaceted traditions of late antique and early Byzantine handicraft from the fourth to the eighth century AD. Its perspective is to pay attention more on patronage, social taste, acculturation, workers and the economic industry of production which supported the demand, circulation and distribution of artefacts, than on the artistic evaluation of the objects themselves.",491,History,en,9783110684438,roman identity 5th-7th
A Globalised Visual Culture? Towards a Geography of Late Antique Art,"Fabio Guidetti, Katharina Meinecke",Oxbow Books,2020-07-31,"Late Antique artefacts, and the images they carry, attest to a highly connected visual culture from ca. 300 to 800 C.E. On the one hand, the same decorative motifs and iconographies are found across various genres of visual and material culture, irrespective of social and economic differences among their users – for instance in mosaics, architectural decoration, and luxury arts (silver plate, textiles, ivories), as well as in everyday objects such as tableware, lamps, and pilgrim vessels. On the other hand, they are also spread in geographically distant regions, mingled with local elements, far beyond the traditional borders of the classical world. At the same time, foreign motifs, especially of Germanic and Sasanian origin, are attested in Roman territories. This volume aims at investigating the reasons behind this seemingly globalised visual culture spread across the Late Antique world, both within the borders of the (former) Roman and (later) Byzantine Empire and beyond, bringing together diverse approaches characteristic of different national and disciplinary traditions. The presentation of a wide range of relevant case studies chosen from different geographical and cultural contexts exemplifies the vast scale of the phenomenon and demonstrates the benefit of addressing such a complex historical question with a combination of different theoretical approaches.",417,Social Science,en,9781789254495,roman identity 5th-7th

Marius' Mules VI Caesar's Vow,S.J.A. Turney,Victrix Books,2014-01-02,"It is the eve of destruction. Gaul seethes and bucks more than ever in revolt against the Roman invader, with even Caesar's allies beginning to question their loyalty. A conspiracy of Druids and Kings move the pieces into position in their great game of independence, all led by the powerful Arverni exile Vercingetorix. The lands of the Belgae burn in the vengeful aftermath of a winter that saw countless Romans butchered by the rebel Eburone King: Ambiorix. As Rome similarly begins to show its cracks and the triumvirate of powerful men that have held together the crumbling Republic move ever further apart, so Fronto returns to the army, once more seeking his command under the great general. But Caesar has made a vow to men and Gods alike to end the life of Ambiorix, and naught will stand in the way of that vow's completion - not Gaul, nor Roman, nor reason itself.

In this year of rising troubles, Priscus will miss his former commander's presence more than ever, while Fronto will learn more than he wishes to of the great Pompey.

"Coptic Culture and Community Daily Lives, Changing Times",Mariam F. Ayad,American University in Cairo Press,2024-01-16,"A wide-ranging exploration of the daily lives of ordinary Coptic Christians, from late Antiquity until today This volume brings together leading experts from a range of disciplines to examine aspects of the daily lived experiences of Egypt’s Coptic Christian minority from late Antiquity to the present. In doing so, it serves as a supplement and a corrective to institutional or theological narratives, which are generally rooted in studying the wielders of historical power and control. Coptic Culture and Community reveals the humanity of the Coptic tradition, giving granular depth to how Copts have lived their lives through and because of their faith for two thousand years. The first three sections consider in turn the breadth of the daily life approach, perspectives on poverty and power in a variety of different contexts, and matters of identity and persecution. The final section reflects on the global Coptic diaspora, bringing themes studied for the early Coptic Church into dialog with Coptic experiences today. These broad categories help to link fundamental questions of socio-religious history with unique aspects of Coptic culture and its vibrant communities of individuals.

Art and Architecture of the Synagogue in Late Antique Palestine In the Shadow of the Church,David William Milson,BRILL,2006-12-31,"This study examines the material evidence for synagogues and churches in the Holy Land from the age of Constantine in the fourth century CE to the Arab conquest of the eastern provinces in the seventh century CE. Whereas scholars once viewed the growth of the Byzantine empire as time of persecution, a re-evaluation of the archaeological evidence indicates that Jews prospered along with their Christian neighbours. What influence did Christian art and architecture have on ancient synagogues? In the sixth century, one-third of all known synagogues in Palestine bear features similar to early Byzantine churches: basilical layouts, mosaic floors, apses, and chancel screens. Focusing on these features sheds light on how Jewish communities met the challenges posed by the Church’s development into a major religious and political power. This book provides a critical analysis of the archaeological evidence as a basis for our better understanding of Jewish identity and community in late Antique Palestine.",608,Religion,en,9789047418719,roman identity 5th-7th
Local Self-Governance in Antiquity and in the Global South Theoretical and Empirical Insights from an Interdisciplinary Perspective,"Dominique Krüger, Christoph Mohamad-Klotzbach, Rene Pfeilschifter",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2022-12-31,"The nucleus of society is situated at the local level: in the village, the neighborhood, the city district. This is where a community first develops collective rules that are intended to ensure its continued existence. The contributors look at such configurations in geographical areas and time periods that lie outside of the modern Western world with its particular development of society and statehood: in Antiquity and in the Global South of the present. Here states tend to be weak, with obvious challenges and opportunities for local communities. How does governance in this context work? Scholars from various disciplines (Classics, Theology, Political Science, Sociology, Social Anthropology, Human Geography, Sinology) analyze different kinds of local arrangements in case studies, and they do so with a comparative approach. The sixteen papers examine the scope and spatial contingency of forms of self-governance; its legitimization and the collective identity of the groups behind them; the relations to different levels of state governance as well as to other local groups. Overall, this volume makes an interdisciplinary contribution to a better understanding of fundamental elements of local governance and statehood.",543,Literary Criticism,en,9783110798326,roman identity 5th-7th

History and Identity in Early Medieval Wales,Rebecca Thomas,Boydell & Brewer,2022,"Crucial texts from ninth- and tenth-century Wales analysed to show their key role in identify formation. WINNER OF THE FRANCIS JONES PRIZE 2022 Early medieval writers viewed the world as divided into gentes (""peoples""). These were groups that could be differentiated from each other according to certain characteristics - by the language they spoke or the territory they inhabited, for example. The same writers played a key role in deciding which characteristics were important and using these to construct ethnic identities. This book explores this process of identity construction in texts from early medieval Wales, focusing primarily on the early ninth-century Latin history of the Britons (Historia Brittonum), the biography of Alfred the Great composed by the Welsh scholar Asser in 893, and the tenth-century vernacular poem Armes Prydein Vawr (""The Great Prophecy of Britain""). It examines how these writers set about distinguishing between the Welsh and the other gentes inhabiting the island of Britain through the use of names, attention to linguistic difference, and the writing of history and origin legends. Crucially important was the identity of the Welsh as Britons, the rightful inhabitants of the entirety of Britain; its significance and durability are investigated, alongside its interaction with the emergence of an identity focused on the geographical unit of Wales.",218,History,en,9781843846277,early medieval history
God and History in the Early Medieval West The Theology of Carolingian Historians,Robert A. H. Evans,Oxford University Press,2025-08-01,"While virtually all early medieval historians wrote about God, they did not do so in the same way. Rather than taking their comments about God at face value then, as has been the case in much work on medieval history-writing, they are deserving of closer scrutiny, with implications not simply for how we understand the key narrative sources for early medieval history, but also the cultures in which they originated. Seeking to fill this historiographical gap, this book explores, through the prolific writing of historians in the Carolingian Empire, how historians in early medieval societies thought about God and what this meant for themselves and their audiences. It argues that although Carolingian historians wrote about God's agency with tremendous literary subtlety, while reflecting complex theological ideas and attempting to intervene into challenging political realities, in many respects they also broke with the example of early Christian historians from Late Antiquity, which demonstrates that writing about God was neither a uniform nor inevitable part of early medieval history writing. As well as yielding new insights into the nature of these crucial primary sources, this analysis helps to provide an overdue examination of the complex relationship between religion and history writing in early medieval societies. The book demonstrates that comments about God cannot be reduced to mere political propaganda or even moralistic encouragements for early medieval Christians to lead better lives. Instead, it argues that these historians sought to communicate a robust theology of divine activity which was relevant and useful for those involved in the often-threatening world of Carolingian public life.",295,Religion,en,9780198957256,early medieval history

In this book, Shami Ghosh analyses the relative significance granted to the Roman and non-Roman inheritances in narratives of the distant past, and what the use of this past reveals about the historical consciousness of early medieval elites, and demonstrates that for them, cultural identity was conceived of in less binary terms than in most modern scholarship.",329,History,en,9789004305816,early medieval history
"The Languages of Early Medieval Charters Latin, Germanic Vernaculars, and the Written Word",,BRILL,2020-11-23,"This is the first major study of the interplay between Latin and Germanic vernaculars in early medieval records. Building on previous work on the uses of the written word in the early Middle Ages, which has dispelled the myth that this was an age of ‘orality’, the contributions in this volume bring to the fore the crucial question of language choice in the documentary cultures of early medieval societies. Specifically, they examine the interactions between Latin and Germanic vernaculars in the Anglo-Saxon and eastern Frankish worlds and in neighbouring areas. The chapters are underpinned by an important comparative dimension on account of the two regions’ shared linguistic heritage and numerous cross-Channel links.

East and West in the Early Middle Ages,"Stefan Esders, Yaniv Fox, Yitzhak Hen, Laury Sarti",Cambridge University Press,2024-09-19,"From their crystallisation in the late fifth century to their ultimate decline in the eighth, the Merovingian kingdoms were a product of a vibrant Mediterranean society with both a cultural past and a dynamic and ongoing dialogue between the member communities. By bringing together the scholarship of historians, archaeologists, art historians, and manuscript researchers, this volume examines the Merovingian world's Mediterranean connections. The Franks' cultural horizons spanned not only the Latin-speaking world, but also the Byzantine Empire, northern Europe, Sassanid Persia, and, after the seventh century, a quickly ascendant Islamic culture. Traces of a constant movement of people and cultural artefacts through this world are ubiquitous. As simultaneous consumers, adapters, and disseminators of culture, the degree to which the Merovingian kingdoms were thought to engage with their neighbours is re-evaluated as this volume analyses written accounts, archaeological findings and artefacts to provide new perspectives on Merovingian wide-ranging relations.",0,History,en,1009563653,early medieval history

Symbolic Reproduction in Early Medieval England Secular and Monastic Households,Katharine Sykes,Oxford University Press,2024-07-12,"In the early Middle Ages, the conversion of the early English kingdoms acted as a catalyst for significant social and cultural change. One of the most visible of these changes was the introduction of a new type of household: the monastic household. These reproduced through education and training, rather than biological means; their inhabitants practised celibacy as a lifelong state, rather than as a stage in the life course. Because monastic households depended on secular households to produce the next generation of recruits, previous studies have tended to view them as more mutable than their secular counterparts, which are implicitly regarded as natural and ahistorical. Katharine Sykes charts some of the significant changes to the structure of households between the seventh to eleventh centuries, as ideas of spiritual, non-biological reproduction first fostered in monastic households were adopted in royal households in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and as ideas about kinship that were generated in secular households, such as the relationship between genealogy and inheritance, were picked up and applied by their monastic counterparts. In place of binary divisions between secular and monastic, biological and spiritual, real and imagined, Sykes demonstrates that different forms of kinship and reproduction in this period were intimately linked.",240,History,en,9780192659125,early medieval history

The case studies in this book shed new light on the process of codification and modification of cultural heritage in the light of the transmission of texts and the extant manuscript evidence from the early middle ages. The authors demonstrate how particular texts and their early medieval manuscript representatives in Italy, Francia, Saxony and Bavaria not only reflect ethnic, social and cultural identities but themselves contributed to the creation of identities, gave meaning to social practice, and were often intended to inspire, guide, change, or prevent action, directly or indirectly.

"Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, 376–568",Guy Halsall,Cambridge University Press,2007-12-20,"This is a major survey of the barbarian migrations and their role in the fall of the Roman Empire and the creation of early medieval Europe, one of the key events in European history. Unlike previous studies it integrates historical and archaeological evidence and discusses Britain, Ireland, mainland Europe and North Africa, demonstrating that the Roman Empire and its neighbours were inextricably linked. A narrative account of the turbulent fifth and early sixth centuries is followed by a description of society and politics during the migration period and an analysis of the mechanisms of settlement and the changes of identity. Guy Halsall reveals that the creation and maintenance of kingdoms and empires was impossible without the active involvement of people in the communities of Europe and North Africa. He concludes that, contrary to most opinions, the fall of the Roman Empire produced the barbarian migrations, not vice versa.",519,History,en,9781107393325,barbarian migrations
Barbarian Tides The Migration Age and the Later Roman Empire,Walter Goffart,University of Pennsylvania Press,2010-11-25,"The Migration Age is still envisioned as an onrush of expansionary ""Germans"" pouring unwanted into the Roman Empire and subjecting it to pressures so great that its western parts collapsed under the weight. Further developing the themes set forth in his classic Barbarians and Romans, Walter Goffart dismantles this grand narrative, shaking the barbarians of late antiquity out of this ""Germanic"" setting and reimagining the role of foreigners in the Later Roman Empire. The Empire was not swamped by a migratory Germanic flood for the simple reason that there was no single ancient Germanic civilization to be transplanted onto ex-Roman soil. Since the sixteenth century, the belief that purposeful Germans existed in parallel with the Romans has been a fixed point in European history. Goffart uncovers the origins of this historical untruth and argues that any projection of a modern Germany out of an ancient one is illusory. Rather, the multiplicity of northern peoples once living on the edges of the Empire participated with the Romans in the larger stirrings of late antiquity. Most relevant among these was the long militarization that gripped late Roman society concurrently with its Christianization. If the fragmented foreign peoples with which the Empire dealt gave Rome an advantage in maintaining its ascendancy, the readiness to admit military talents of any social origin to positions of leadership opened the door of imperial service to immigrants from beyond its frontiers. Many barbarians were settled in the provinces without dislodging the Roman residents or destabilizing landownership; some were even incorporated into the ruling families of the Empire. The outcome of this process, Goffart argues, was a society headed by elites of soldiers and Christian clergy—one we have come to call medieval.",384,History,en,9780812200287,barbarian migrations
Byzantium in the Eleventh Century Being in Between,"Marc D. Lauxtermann, Mark Whittow",Routledge,2019-10-18,"The eleventh century in Byzantium is all about being in between, whether this is between Basil II and Alexios Komnenos, between the forces of the Normans, the Pechenegs and the Turks, or between different social groupings, cultural identities and religious persuasions. It is a period of fundamental changes and transformations, both internal and external, but also a period rife with clichés and dominated by the towering presence of Michael Psellos whose usually self-contradictory accounts continue to loom large in the field of Byzantine studies. The essays collected here, which were delivered at the 45th Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, explore new avenues of research and offer new perspectives on this transitional period. The book is divided into four thematic clusters: 'The age of Psellos' studies this crucial figure and seeks to situate him in his time; 'Social structures' is concerned with the ways in which the deep structures of Byzantine society and economy responded to change; 'State and Church' offers a set of studies of various political developments in eleventh-century Byzantium; and 'The age of spirituality' offers the voices of those for whom Psellos had little time and little use: monks, religious thinkers and pious laymen.",252,History,en,9781351803960,barbarian migrations

The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians,J. B. Bury,Jovian Press,2017-12-20,"THE present series of lectures is designed to give a broad and general view of the long sequence of the migratory movements of the northern barbarians which began in the third and fourth centuries A. D. and cannot be said to have terminated till the ninth. This long process shaped Europe into its present form, and it must be grasped in its broad outlines in order to understand the framework of modern Europe. There are two ways in which the subject may be treated, two points of view from which the sequence of changes which broke up the Roman Empire may be regarded. We may look at the process, in the earliest and most important stage, from the point of view of the Empire which was being dismembered or from that of the barbarians who were dismembering it. We may stand in Rome and watch the strangers sweeping over her provinces; or we may stand east of the Rhine and north of the Danube, amid the forests of Germany, and follow the fortunes of the men who issued thence, winning new habitations and entering on a new life. Both methods have been followed by modern writers. Gibbon and many others have told the story from the side of the Roman Empire, but all the principal barbarian peoples - not only those who founded permanent states, but even those who formed only transient kingdoms - have had each its special historian. One naturally falls into the habit of contemplating these events from the Roman side because the early part of the story has come down to us in records which were written from the Roman side. We must, however, try to see things from both points of view...",141,History,en,9781537809656,barbarian migrations
Empires and Barbarians,Peter J. Heather,Pan Macmillan,2009,"""At the start of the first millennium AD, southern and western Europe formed part of the Mediterranean-based Roman Empire, the largest state western Eurasia has ever known, and was set firmly on a trajectory towards towns, writing, mosaics, and central heating. Central, northern and eastern Europe was home to subsistence farmers, living in wooden houses with mud floors, whose largest political units weighed in at no more than a few thousand people. By the year 1000, Mediterranean domination of the European landscape had been destroyed. Instead of one huge Empire facing loosely organized subsistence farmers, Europe - from the Atlantic almost to the Urals - was home to an interacting commonwealth of Christian states, many of which are still with us today.

Viking Heritage and History in Europe Practices and Re-creations,"Sara Ellis Nilsson, Stefan Nyzell",Taylor & Francis,2024-03-06,"Viking Heritage and History in Europe presents new research and perspectives on the use of the Vikings in public history, especially in relation to museums, re-creation, and re-enactment in a European context. Taking a critical heritage approach, the volume provides new insights into the re-creation of history, imagining the past, interpretation, ambivalence of authenticity, authority of History, remembrance and memory, medievalism, and public history. Highlighting the complexity of the field of public history today, the fourteen chapters all engage with questions of historical authenticity and authority. The volume also critically examines the public’s reception, engagement with, and interpretation of the Viking Age and the concepts of who these individuals were. Each chapter illuminates an aspect of these themes in relation to museums, leisure activities, politics, tourism, re-enactment, and popular culture – all from the vantage point of Viking cultural heritage. Viking Heritage and History in Europe is one of the first volumes to examine the use and role of the Vikings within the field of public history, both past and present.

"The Performance of Viking Identity in Museums Useful Heritage in the British Isles, Iceland, and Norway",Guðrún D. Whitehead,Taylor & Francis,2024-08-12,"The Performance of Viking Identity in Museums explores the representations and uses of Vikings in museums across Iceland, British Isles and Norway. Drawing on theories from history, philosophy, museology, and sociology, the book analyses how the Viking myth is used by visitors to make sense of present-day society, culture, and politics and the role of museums in this meaning-making process. Demonstrating that the Viking myth is present in collective memory and plays an important role in the construction and modification of collective, national, and personal identities, the book analyses this process through the framework of museums and their visitors. Identifying museums as places where heritage, identity and social norms are affirmed and reflected upon, Whitehead demonstrates that all countries use their Viking heritage to define their identity on a local and international level - through tourist attractions such as museums and other Viking-related monuments and merchandise. Providing readers with an insight into Vikings and their social relevance today, The Performance of Viking Identity in Museums will be of great interest to academics and researchers across the social and human sciences.

Evidence for their lives is fragmentary, but Judith Jesch assembles the clues provided by archaeology, runic inscriptions, place names and personal names, foreign historical records and Old Norse literature and mythology. These sources illuminate different aspects of women's lives in the Viking age, on the farms and in the trading centres of Scandinavia, abroad on Viking expeditions, and as settlers in places such as Iceland and the British Isles.

The Viking's Dirham: Trade and Politics in the Early Medieval World,Pasquale De Marco,Pasquale De Marco,2025-08-13,"The Viking Age was a period of great change and upheaval in Europe. The Vikings, a seafaring people from Scandinavia, raided and traded throughout the continent, leaving a lasting impact on the history of many countries. One of the most important objects that the Vikings brought with them was the dirham, a silver coin that was widely used in the Islamic world. The dirham was first introduced to the Vikings through their trading contacts with the Abbasid Caliphate. The Caliphate was a powerful Islamic empire that stretched from Spain to India. The dirham was the official currency of the Caliphate, and it was widely used in trade throughout the Islamic world. The Vikings quickly recognized the value of the dirham. It was a stable currency that was accepted by merchants throughout the Islamic world. The Vikings began to use the dirham to pay for goods and services, and they also used it to store their wealth. The dirham had a profound impact on the Viking economy. It allowed the Vikings to participate in the lucrative trade networks of the Islamic world. The Vikings used the dirham to purchase luxury goods, such as silk, spices, and jewelry. They also used the dirham to purchase weapons and armor. The dirham also had a significant impact on Viking society. It was used to pay for food, clothing, and shelter. The dirham was also used to pay for fines and other legal obligations. This book examines the role of the dirham in the Viking Age. It explores the economic, social, and political impact of the dirham on the Vikings. The book also discusses the legacy of the dirham in Viking history. This book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the Viking Age. It provides a comprehensive overview of the role of the dirham in Viking history. The book is written in a clear and engaging style, and it is accessible to readers of all levels.

Historical Dictionary of the Vikings,Katherine Holman,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,2003-09-29,"The Historical Dictionary of the Vikings traces Viking activity in Europe, North America, and Asia for over three centuries. During this period people from Scandinavia used their longships to launch lightning raids upon their European neighbors, to colonize new lands in the east and west, and to exchange Scandinavian furs for eastern wine and spices and Arab silver. The Viking age also saw significant changes at home in Scandinavia - kings extended their power, Norse paganism lost ground to christianity, and new towns and ports thrived as a result of increased contact with the wider world. This book provides a comprehensive work of reference for people interested in the Vikings, including entries on the main historical figures involved in this dramatic period, important battles and treaties, significant archaeological finds, and key works and sources of information on the period.

At the same time it engendered a need to ensure that clergy, monks and laity embraced orthodox Christian doctrine. This book offers a fresh perspective on the period by examining transformations in a major current of thought as revealed through literature and artistic imagery: the doctrine of the Passion and the crucified Christ.

It considers the audiences for history in the Frankish kingdoms, the recording of memory in new genres including narrative histories, cartularies and Libri memoriales, and thus particular perceptions of the Frankish and Christian past. It analyses both original manuscript material and key historical texts from the Carolingian period, a remarkably creative period in the history of European culture. Presentations of the past developed in this period were crucial in forming an historical understanding of the Greco-Roman and Judaeo-Christian past and, in subsequent centuries, of early medieval Europe.

"Carolingian Connections Anglo-Saxon England and Carolingian Francia, C. 750-870",Joanna Story,Routledge,2003,"The Anglo-Saxon influence on the Carolingian world has long been recognised by historians of the early medieval period. Wilhelm Levison, in particular, has drawn attention to the importance of the Anglo-Saxon contribution to the cultural and ecclesiastical development of Carolingian Francia in the central decades of the eighth century. What is much less familiar is the reverse process, by which Francia and Carolingian concepts came to influence contemporary Anglo-Saxon culture. In this book Dr Story offers a major contribution to the subject of medieval cultural exchanges, focusing on the degree to which Frankish ideas and concepts were adopted by Anglo-Saxon rulers. Furthermore, by concentrating on the secular context and concepts of secular government as opposed to the more familiar ecclesiastical and missionary focus of Levison's work, this book offers a counterweight to the prevailing scholarship, providing a much more balanced overview of the subject. Through this reassessment, based on a close analysis of contemporary manuscripts - particularly the Northumbrian sources - Dr Story offers a fresh insight into the world of early medieval Europe.",342,History,en,,carolingian
The Carolingian Empire: the History and Legacy of the Frankish Rulers Who Unified Most of Europe and Established the Holy Roman Empire in the Middle Ages,Charles River Charles River Editors,,2019-01-04,"*Includes pictures *Includes medieval accounts *Includes online resources and a bibliography for further reading The Carolingian Dynasty, which carved out a major empire in Europe from 750-887, ushered in an important period in the Early Middle Ages. The Carolingians were in their time seen as the successors of Ancient Rome in the West, and while they sought to reestablish the glory of antiquity, they're remembered today for effectively founding the states that would become France and Germany. The Carolingians are also credited with creating the first Renaissance, the Carolingian Renaissance, centuries before the Italian Renaissance. Many of the great Latin classics survive today because of copies made during this period. In addition, the revisions made to written script at this time made texts easier to read, so much so that most of those changes remain in the modern system of writing. The Carolingians lived at a moment in time where they saw that antiquity was seen as worth preserving, but they also sought to adapt it to the times, setting the groundwork for many aspects of what would become the modern world. Nobody was more important in bringing this about than Charlemagne, the most famous man of the Middle Ages, and likely the most influential. Upon the death of his father, Pepin the Short, in 768, Charlemagne became King of the Franks, and he proceeded to create one of the largest European empires since the collapse of Rome. Through his conquests across Western Europe and Italy, Charlemagne became the first Holy Roman Emperor after a famous imperial coronation by Pope Leo III. In becoming the first Holy Roman Emperor, Charlemagne essentially established the new order on the European continent, thereby directly influencing how European politics and royalty proceeded in the coming centuries. As if to demonstrate how large he loomed in life, Charlemagne was numbered Charles I in Germany, France, and the Holy Roman Empire. Charlemagne is also viewed as having brought about the Carolingian Renaissance, a revival of art, religion, and culture through the Catholic Church. This helped establish a uniform European culture, helping Charlemagne earn the title ""Father of Europe."" After World War II, when France and Germany were looking for common ground, Charlemagne would often be held up as a unifying force between peoples who had so often been enemies. The Carolingian Empire: The History and Legacy of the Frankish Rulers Who Unified Most of Europe and Established the Holy Roman Empire in the Middle Ages profiles the rulers who helped bring about modern Europe, and the history of their empire. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Carolingians like never before.",43,,en,1793143560,carolingian

Indeed, the refusal to assemble and other forms of “slantwise” assembly became a weapon of the powerless. Bobrycki investigates what happened when demographic realities shifted, but culture, religion, and politics remained bound by the past.

These longtime enemies eventually fought a conflict that would last 27 years, weakening the entire country and making Greece ripe for conquest by invaders.",0,"Civilization, Medieval",en,1601521510,early middle ages
Making Money in the Early Middle Ages,Rory Naismith,Princeton University Press,2026-02-24,"An examination of coined money and its significance to rulers, aristocrats and peasants in early medieval Europe Between the end of the Roman Empire in the fifth century and the economic transformations of the twelfth, coined money in western Europe was scarce and high in value, difficult for the majority of the population to make use of. And yet, as Rory Naismith shows in this illuminating study, coined money was made and used throughout early medieval Europe. It was, he argues, a powerful tool for articulating people’s place in economic and social structures and an important gauge for levels of economic complexity. Working from the premise that using coined money carried special significance when there was less of it around, Naismith uses detailed case studies from the Mediterranean and northern Europe to propose a new reading of early medieval money as a point of contact between economic, social, and institutional history. Naismith examines structural issues, including the mining and circulation of metal and the use of bullion and other commodities as money, and then offers a chronological account of monetary development, discussing the post-Roman period of gold coinage, the rise of the silver penny in the seventh century and the reconfiguration of elite power in relation to coinage in the tenth and eleventh centuries. In the process, he counters the conventional view of early medieval currency as the domain only of elite gift-givers and intrepid long-distance traders. Even when there were few coins in circulation, Naismith argues, the ways they were used—to give gifts, to pay rents, to spend at markets—have much to tell us.",544,Business & Economics,en,9780691249346,early middle ages
"Family, Friends and Followers Political and Social Bonds in Early Medieval Europe",Gerd Althoff,Cambridge University Press,2004-06-03,"Political life in the middle ages was influenced heavily by the bonds people had to one another. Among these, the bonds of kinship, friendship and lordship were by far the most important. Ritual was also often used to create and strengthen these bonds, and conduct and behaviour within social groups was shaped by unwritten rules. People bound in these ways had a right to expect help and support from one another. Such bonds were both a fact and a necessity of life in the middle ages. Over time, however, these bonds and relationships changed, as did the rules and norms which governed them. The aim of this book is to document and describe the history of these crucial bonds, and the ways in which they shaped political life in Europe in the early and high middle ages.",212,History,en,0521779340,early middle ages

Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. The period of the early Middle Ages - from the fourth to the eleventh centuries—used to be commonly called ""the dark ages."" Now that term has been discarded by scholars, who reject its implications as they recognize increasingly, the historical importance of the period. In this volume eight historians, in as many essays, discuss various aspects of the life and thought which prevailed during the centuries which extended from the time of the establishment of Germanic ""successor states"" in the western provinces of the Roman Empire to the appearance of some of the economic and feudal institutions which provided a basis for the civilization of the high Middle Ages. The essay, by showing that a process of assimilation and synthesis of the Roman, Christian, and barbarian elements characterized life in the early Middle Ages, demonstrate that the significance of the period is far better indicated by words like ""transition"" or ""transformation"" than by the term ""dark ages.""

The Arabic-Islamic representation of the Byzantine Empire stretching from the reference to Byzantium in the Qur'an until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered in terms of a few salient themes. The image of Byzantium reveals itself to be complex, non-monolithic, and self-referential.

American Dark Age Racial Feudalism and the Rise of Black Liberalism,Keidrick Roy,Princeton University Press,2024-09-24,"How medieval-inspired racial feudalism reigned in early America and was challenged by Black liberal thinkers Though the United States has been heralded as a beacon of democracy, many nineteenth-century Americans viewed their nation through the prism of the Old World. What they saw was a racially stratified country that reflected not the ideals of a modern republic but rather the remnants of feudalism. American Dark Age reveals how defenders of racial hierarchy embraced America’s resemblance to medieval Europe and tells the stories of the abolitionists who exposed it as a glaring blemish on the national conscience. Against those seeking to maintain what Frederick Douglass called an “aristocracy of the skin,” Keidrick Roy shows how a group of Black thinkers, including Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Hosea Easton, and Harriet Jacobs, challenged the medievalism in their midst—and transformed the nation’s founding liberal tradition. He demonstrates how they drew on spiritual insight, Enlightenment thought, and a homegrown political philosophy that gave expression to their experiences at the bottom of the American social order. Roy sheds new light on how Black abolitionist writers and activists worked to eradicate the pernicious ideology of racial feudalism from American liberalism and renew the country’s commitment to values such as individual liberty, social progress, and egalitarianism. American Dark Age reveals how the antebellum Black liberal tradition holds vital lessons for us today as hate groups continue to align themselves with fantasies of a medieval past and openly call for a return of all-powerful monarchs, aristocrats, and nobles who rule by virtue of their race.",376,Political Science,en,9780691252506,dark ages

Several hundred years after the end of the worlds second ice-age and the near extinction of the human race, mankind is in a state of rebuilding. The technology that we once took for granted, and believed would usher us into the future, has become nothing more than a myth to a species that is once again on the brink of destruction. War looms on the horizon, a war that has been going on since the dawn of creation. Now it would seem that the final pieces of a dark, menacing plan have been put into play, and mankinds darkest hour is at hand. But all this is irrelevant to one woman. Luna Ayala-Kin, Infantry General of the once prominent Tereye army, has embarked on a murderous quest for revenge after having everything that she once cherished violently stripped away. The loss of her young child has driven her to the point of utter madness, and she has vowed to stop at nothing until her blade is coated in the blood of the one that took her daughters life. Her three year journey has left nothing but devastation in her wake, and still she has not found the answers that she seeks, answers that could lead her to the kingdom of Golgotha, and her quests end. With hope and sanity rapidly dwindling, at her most vulnerable state, a dark and magical being from her past has offered her the key to her success, at a price that may be too steep. The temptation will change everything.

Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem with a Discussion of the Stories of Offa and Finn Exploring Epic Heroes and Medieval Narratives,R. W. Chambers,Good Press,2019-11-19,"R. W. Chambers' 'Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem with a Discussion of the Stories of Offa and Finn' serves as a critical scholarly examination of one of the most significant works in Old English literature. Chambers adeptly unpacks the rich tapestry of themes, characters, and linguistic artistry that underpin the epic poem 'Beowulf,' while situating it within its historical and cultural milieu. Through detailed analysis, he elucidates not only the narrative structure and poetic devices employed by the unknown author of 'Beowulf,' but also draws insightful connections to related narratives such as those of Offa and Finn, enriching our understanding of the intertextual nature of early medieval storytelling. R. W. Chambers, an esteemed scholar of English literature and medieval studies, greatly contributed to the academic dialogue surrounding Anglo-Saxon texts. His extensive training and background in philology and Old English literature inform the depth and precision of his analysis in this particular work. Chambers'Äô scholarly pursuits reflect a dedication to illuminating the complexities of the past, enabling modern readers and scholars to engage more profoundly with these ancient texts. This compelling introduction to 'Beowulf' is essential for anyone seeking to grasp the nuances of this foundational epic.

"BEOWULF (Collector's Edition) With 3 Different Modern English Translations & the Original Anglo-Saxon Edition (Including an extensive study of the poem, footnotes, index and alphabetical glossary)",Anonymous,e-artnow,2017-11-15,"Beowulf is the conventional title of an Old English heroic epic poem consisting of 3182 alliterative long lines, set in Scandinavia, commonly cited as one of the most important works of Anglo-Saxon literature. It survives in a single manuscript known as the Nowell Codex. Its composition by an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet is dated between the 8th and the early 11th century. In 1731, the manuscript was badly damaged by a fire that swept through a building housing a collection of Medieval manuscripts assembled by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton. The poem's existence for its first seven centuries or so made no impression on writers and scholars, and besides a brief mention in a 1705 catalogue by Humfrey Wanley it was not studied until the end of the eighteenth century, and not published in its entirety until the 1815 edition prepared by the Icelandic-Danish scholar Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin. In the poem, Beowulf, a hero of the Geats in Scandinavia, comes to the help of Hroðgar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall (in Heorot) has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland in Sweden and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty years has passed, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is fatally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants bury him in a tumulus, a burial mound, in Geatland.

Traditionalists explain the spread of proto-Slavic as a result of migrations in the 6th?7th century and associate that with a specific material culture and with early mentions of ethnic Slavs in written sources. Alternative hypotheses attribute the same evidence to linguistically and genetically quite varied communities and associate the later spread of proto-Slavic with its status as a ?lingua franca? or ?koiné?. 0The papers in the present volume interpret new methodological and empirical findings from several fields of study, not only from the traditional triad of linguistics, archaeology, and historiography, but also from adjacent disciplines such as religious studies, cultural anthropology, archaeogenetics, and others. The unifying thread is that the question of the relations between Slavic language, ethnicity, and material culture has differing answers in different geographical and political contexts.",353,,en,3825347079,early slavs

A Corpus of Roman Engraved Gemstones from British Sites,Martin Henig,Archaeopress Archaeology,1978,"'The primary purpose of an engraved gem or ring-bezel, cut in intaglio, was to make an impression upon some fictile material., which would be understood by the owner of the device, and by his associates, as a personal signature.' So began Martin Henig's original BAR Number 7 from 1978, in the British Series of British Archaeological Reports, a catalogue and study of over 1000 Roman engraved gemstones from the British Isles. Nearly 30 years later comes the third edition of this study, the new Preface to which concludes: 'Over the years I have thought more about gems in relation to other arts and have integrated glyptics into my book on The Art of Roman Britain (1995). Several papers I have written recently have attempted to use gems, like sculpture, painting and bronzes to elucidate general artistic problems. This should be obvious but how many art-historians seem to have the inclination to take gems seriously? At least interest in provincial glyptics seems greater today and that gives me grounds for hope Important studies are being conducted across the Empire ranging from Belgium . and Portugal ., toTurkey . andIsrael. It is for each new generation to reassess theevidence, in the case of our subjectwith the aid of new techniques, of computing on the one hand and scientific analysis of materials and cutting techniques on the other. In addition the fresh eye of youth is always invaluable. Someone else can often see what should have been obvious to one all the time. (Wolfson College, Oxford.

Goth Undead Subculture,"Michael Bibby, Lauren M. E. Goodlad",Duke University Press,2007-04-11,"Since it first emerged from Britain’s punk-rock scene in the late 1970s, goth subculture has haunted postmodern culture and society, reinventing itself inside and against the mainstream. Goth: Undead Subculture is the first collection of scholarly essays devoted to this enduring yet little examined cultural phenomenon. Twenty-three essays from various disciplines explore the music, cinema, television, fashion, literature, aesthetics, and fandoms associated with the subculture. They examine goth’s many dimensions—including its melancholy, androgyny, spirituality, and perversity—and take readers inside locations in Los Angeles, Austin, Leeds, London, Buffalo, New York City, and Sydney. A number of the contributors are or have been participants in the subculture, and several draw on their own experiences. The volume’s editors provide a rich history of goth, describing its play of resistance and consumerism; its impact on class, race, and gender; and its distinctive features as an “undead” subculture in light of post-subculture studies and other critical approaches. The essays include an interview with the distinguished fashion historian Valerie Steele; analyses of novels by Anne Rice, Poppy Z. Brite, and Nick Cave; discussions of goths on the Internet; and readings of iconic goth texts from Bram Stoker’s Dracula to James O’Barr’s graphic novel The Crow. Other essays focus on gothic music, including seminal precursors such as Joy Division and David Bowie, and goth-influenced performers such as the Cure, Nine Inch Nails, and Marilyn Manson. Gothic sexuality is explored in multiple ways, the subjects ranging from the San Francisco queercore scene of the 1980s to the increasing influence of fetishism and fetish play. Together these essays demonstrate that while its participants are often middle-class suburbanites, goth blurs normalizing boundaries even as it appears as an everlasting shadow of late capitalism.

""To the mundane,"" Voltaire writes, ""Goths are weird, black-clad freaks who are obsessed with death; they are sad all of the time. Take a closer look at the Goth scene, however, and you will find a rich tapestry of ideas and practices and a menagerie of colorful characters. Oh, dear. I said 'colorful.'"" Yes, Goths are pale, wear black clothing, love black makeup (on men and women), mope, listen to real downer music, and perfect the art of living in a perpetual state of ennui and melancholy. But there's so much more to being Goth. Goths come from all walks of life. Many are teenagers who live with their parents; others are doctors, lawyers, musicians, and so on. Most Goths are highly literate and creative, but all real Goths have to dress the part. In other words, ""Abandon all hope ye who enter a Goth club in khakis!""

This book proposes a new view, through a case-study of the Goths of Italy between 489 and 554. It contains a detailed examination of the personal details and biographies of 379 individuals and compares their behaviour with ideological texts of the time. This inquiry suggests wholly new ways of understanding the appearance of barbarian groups and the end of the western Roman Empire, as well as proposing new models of regional and professional loyalty and group cohesion.

The Visigoths in History and Legend,J. N. Hillgarth,PIMS,2009,"This book explores one of the central myths of Spain: the idea that Spanish culture arose from that of the Visigoths. It begins with a sketch of Visigothic history, then proceeds to explore attitudes towards the Goths and legends and myths that developed around them from late antiquity to the twentieth century; such ideas proved influential among those who saw the Goths as their spiritual, if not literal, ancestors. The focus is on the myth of the Goths as expressed in literature of a broadly historical nature; many authors have played a significant role in forming and shaping this myth, and thus in shaping the mentality of their contemporaries and descendants. The Gothic myth was of great use to the different monarchies that succeeded the Goths after the Arabic invasion of 711. Visigothic kings were adopted as models by one age after another, from the rudimentary kingdom of Asturias in the ninth century to the world-monarchy of Spain under the Catholic Kings and the Habsburgs. Over the centuries, adroit 'improvements' on history and even outright fabrications influenced the creation of an idealized, epic past to which Spaniards look even today. This study of the evolution and persistence of the myth of Spain's Gothic roots is essential reading for scholars of Spanish history.",260,History,en,,visigoths

The Early Medieval World: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne addresses the social and material culture of this critical period in the evolution of Western society, covering the social, political, cultural, and religious history of the Mediterranean world and northern Europe. The two-volume set explains how invading and migrating barbarian tribes—spurred by raiding Huns from the steppes of Central Asia—contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and documents how the blending of Greco-Roman, Germanic, and Christian cultures birthed a new civilization in Western Europe, creating the Christian Church and the modern nation-state. A-Z entries discuss political transformation, changing religious practices in daily life, sculpture and the arts, material culture, and social structure, and provide biographies of important men and women in the transitional period of late antiquity.

Mediating Sovereign Debt Disputes,Calliope Makedon Sudborough,Springer Nature,2023-12-07,"This book provides a fresh perspective on resolving sovereign debt disputes within the investor-state mediation framework. In response to the limitations of traditional approaches to adjudicating public debt issues and the resulting gaps in international law concerning sovereign defaults, creditors have increasingly turned to investor-state treaty arbitrations to recover unpaid debts. However, this shift has raised numerous criticisms and concerns. Accordingly, this book explores the uncharted territory of utilizing mediation as a means to settle sovereign debt claims. It sheds light on the distinctive characteristics of mediation as a process, setting it apart from judicial litigation and private arbitration, and emphasizing the unique outcomes it can generate. The central argument of this book is that mediation should be seriously considered as a viable option for resolving sovereign debt disputes. Not only does it offer a more cost-effective and expeditious approach, but it also has the potential to facilitate economic recovery and sustain continued investment.",188,Law,en,9783031467875,alemanni

The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians,Peter Heather,"Oxford University Press, USA",2005-10-28,"The death of the Roman Empire is one of the perennial mysteries of world history. Now, in this groundbreaking book, Peter Heather proposes a stunning new solution: Centuries of imperialism turned the neighbors Rome called barbarians into an enemy capable of dismantling an Empire that had dominated their lives for so long. A leading authority on the late Roman Empire and on the barbarians, Heather relates the extraordinary story of how Europe's barbarians, transformed by centuries of contact with Rome on every possible level, eventually pulled the empire apart. He shows first how the Huns overturned the existing strategic balance of power on Rome's European frontiers, to force the Goths and others to seek refuge inside the Empire. This prompted two generations of struggle, during which new barbarian coalitions, formed in response to Roman hostility, brought the Roman west to its knees. The Goths first destroyed a Roman army at the battle of Hadrianople in 378, and went on to sack Rome in 410. The Vandals spread devastation in Gaul and Spain, before conquering North Africa, the breadbasket of the Western Empire, in 439. We then meet Attila the Hun, whose reign of terror swept from Constantinople to Paris, but whose death in 453 ironically precipitated a final desperate phase of Roman collapse, culminating in the Vandals' defeat of the massive Byzantine Armada: the west's last chance for survival. Peter Heather convincingly argues that the Roman Empire was not on the brink of social or moral collapse. What brought it to an end were the barbarians.",610,History,en,0195159543,gepids
"The Making of the Slavs History and Archaeology of the Lower Danube Region, c.500–700",Florin Curta,Cambridge University Press,2001-07-12,"This book offers an alternative approach to the problem of Slavic ethnicity in south-eastern Europe between c. 500 and c. 700, from the perspective of current anthropological theories. The conceptual emphasis here is on the relation between material culture and ethnicity. The author demonstrates that the history of the Sclavenes and the Antes begins only at around 500 AD. He also points to the significance of the archaeological evidence, which suggests that specific artefacts may have been used as identity markers. This evidence also indicates the role of local leaders in building group boundaries and in leading successful raids across the Danube. Because of these military and political developments, Byzantine authors began employing names such as Sclavines and Antes in order to make sense of the process of group identification that was taking place north of the Danube frontier. Slavic ethnicity is therefore shown to be a Byzantine invention.",494,History,en,9781139428880,gepids

This book provides answers to each of these five questions, while also solving other mysteries - the identity of the enigmatic river Drecon, the name of the village of Attila's sister-in-law, and the true course of Attila's Gallic campaign in 451 and his Italian campaign in 452.",446,History,en,9783759756879,gepids

Bury, Edward Creasy, Henry Bradley, Edward Gibbon, David Hume, Charles Oman",Biblioteq,2024-02-22,"The Dark Ages is a historical periodization traditionally referring to the Middle Ages, that asserts that a demographic, cultural, and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the decline of the Roman Empire. The term employs traditional light-versus-darkness imagery to contrast the era's ""darkness"" (lack of records) with earlier and later periods of ""light"" (abundance of records).The concept of a ""Dark Age"" originated in the 1330s with the Italian scholar Petrarch, who regarded the post-Roman centuries as ""dark"" compared to the light of classical antiquity.

A History of the Later Roman Empire (Vol. 1&2) From the Death of Theodosius I to the Death of Justinian - German Conquest of Western Europe & the Age of Justinian,J. B. Bury,Good Press,2023-12-03,"J. B. Bury's ""A History of the Later Roman Empire"" (Volumes 1 & 2) serves as a comprehensive examination of the social, political, and military transformations of the Roman Empire from 284 AD until its eventual decline. Bury employs a meticulous analytical approach, blending rigorous primary source research with a narrative style that is both engaging and informative. His exploration delves into the intricacies of imperial administration, the rise of external threats, and the impact of Christianity, meticulously contextualizing each event within the broader tapestry of Roman history and contemporary scholarship. As an eminent historian and scholar of classical studies, J. B. Bury's academic background, notably his tenure at Trinity College, Dublin, and his deep engagement with the classical tradition, profoundly influenced his writing. His previous work in historiography and dedication to historical accuracy underscore Bury's intent to present a nuanced, multifaceted view of a critical era in Western history. Through his writings, Bury seeks to illuminate the complexities of the Roman Empire's later years, fostering a richer understanding of its legacy. I highly recommend Bury'Äôs work to those intrigued by the Roman Empire's transition and decline, as it offers both depth and clarity, making it an essential addition to the libraries of students and scholars alike. The work's scholarly rigor, combined with its eloquent prose, provides readers with an invaluable resource for understanding the multifarious dynamics at play during this pivotal period.",908,History,en,,gepids
Lombard Houses in St. Petersburg Pawing [sic] as a Survival Strategy of Low-income Households?,Heiko Schrader,LIT Verlag Münster,2000,""" The book is an outcome of a research project on pawnshops in Saint Petersburg, which took place in 1999/2000 in cooperation with the Center of Independent Social Research. It relates to the function of pawnshops in the life strategies of low-income households. The research investigated different topics with various methods: a reconstruction of the history of Russian pawnshops based on secondary materials and government reports; a description of the current pawnshop landscape in Saint Petersburg based upon secondary material and own information; a questionnaire of 100 pawnshop customers focusing on demographic data of the respondents and their households, the living conditions, the income situation, the importance of pawnshops in their life strategies, the use of credit, alternative sources of credit, defaults, and the like; five pre-structured deep interviews of pawnshop customers who already had lombard experience in Soviet times to work out differences and similarities, as well as the psychological component of pawning; open pre-structured interviews with pawnshop directors on their companies' business, their target group and the pawnshop market; and finally a profile of one successful private firm in the market and the biography of its chairman. In addition to an institutional analysis the book aims at a description of the milieu of pawnshop customers, which is shaped by an ongoing crisis of the Russian economy and society. Heiko Schrader is an economist and sociologist. His present position is Professor for Sociology at the University of Magdeburg and Visiting Professor for Social Anthropology at the State University of Saint Petersburg. He published extensively on development sociology and social anthropology. """,196,Business & Economics,en,3825851095,lombards

The Baiuvarii and Thuringi An Ethnographic Perspective,"Janine Fries-Knoblach, Heiko Steuer, John Hines, Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Social Stress",Boydell & Brewer Ltd,2014,"The large neighbouring tribes of the Baiuvarii and Thuringi, who lived between the Alps and the River Elbe from the fifth to eighth centuries, are the focus of this book. Using a variety of different sources drawn from the fields of archaeology, history, linguistics and religion, the contributions discuss how an ethnos, a gens, or a tribe, such as the Baiuvarii or Thuringi, might appear in the written and archaeological evidence. For the Thuringi tribal traditions started around the year 400 or even earlier, while the Baiuvarii experienced a much later ethnogenesis from both immigrants and a local, partly Romance population in the mid-sixth century. The Baiuvarii and Thuringi are studied together because of the astonishing connections between their two settlement landscapes. In the context of the row-grave civilisation the Thuringi belonged primarily to the eastern, the Baiuvarii to the western sphere. The kingdom of the Thuringi was assimilated into the Merovingian Empire after their defeat by the Franks in the 530s, which also changed their burial customs to the style of the western row-grave zone. In contrast, the Baiuvarii were not ""Frankicised"" until more than a century later and their grave customs remained more typically ""Bavarian"". The chapters highlight typical features of each region and beyond: settlements, agricultural economy, law, religion, language, names, craftsmanship, grave goods, mobility and communication.",398,History,en,9781843839156,thuringians

This includes maintenance and support of desktop software, SAP software as the large-scale back end, web-based applications belonging to the intranet of the Bundeswehr, and communication programs such as IBM’s Lotus Notes. Siemens will be responsible for operating and modernizing the decentralized systems at more than 1,500 locations in Germany, encompassing 140,000 PCs, 7,000 servers, 300,000 fixed-network telephones and 15,000 mobile phones. In terms of objectives (Newman: 2001), the BWI IT was created predominantly to bear the enormous financial upfront investment of the project. The yearly parliamentary approved defence budgets were neither flexible nor big enough to engage a project of this dimension. The Social Science Institute of the Bundeswehr (SOWI) has been charged with the evaluation of HERKULES. In my functional capacity I have had the opportunity to contribute actively to the performance evaluation to date. This paper outlines the scope and schedule of HERKULES and identifies the major (dis-)advantages of this PPP compared to unilateral public policy implementation. Special focus is given to the question of risk sharing and the project inherent partnership dynamics. Hereafter, potential room for improvement and areas of concern are being analysed.

Avars Central Asian Nomads Who Established an Empire in Eastern Europe,Rolf Hedger,,2025-07-18,"In the middle of the sixth century CE, Europe trembled before a new threat emerging from the vast steppes of Central Asia. The Avars, a confederation of nomadic tribes whose very name struck fear into the hearts of settled peoples, came riding westward with a fury that would reshape the political landscape of Eastern Europe for the next two and a half centuries. Their arrival marked the beginning of one of the most successful nomadic empires in European history, a realm that would stretch from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and challenge the might of the Byzantine Empire itself. The first whispers of their approach reached Constantinople through the reports of frightened merchants and fleeing refugees. These accounts spoke of horsemen whose skill in warfare surpassed even that of the feared Huns, warriors who moved with lightning speed across the steppes and whose military innovations would revolutionize the art of warfare in medieval Europe. The Avars were not merely another wave of barbarian raiders; they were the architects of a sophisticated political and military system that would dominate the Pannonian Basin and surrounding regions for generations. The origins of the Avars remain shrouded in the mists of Central Asian history, but their emergence as a major force can be traced to the complex political upheavals that characterized the steppes in the aftermath of the Hunnic Empire's collapse. The death of Attila in 453 CE had left a power vacuum in the nomadic world, one that various tribal confederations struggled to fill. The Avars emerged from this chaos as a coalition of diverse peoples, united under the leadership of a ruling clan that possessed both the military acumen and political sophistication necessary to forge a lasting empire.",29,History,en,,avars

Daily Telegraph 'A masterpiece' De Morgen 'A history book that reads like a thriller' Le Soir At the end of the fifteenth century, Burgundy was extinguished as an independent state. It had been a fabulously wealthy, turbulent region situated between France and Germany, with close links to the English kingdom. Torn apart by the dynastic struggles of early modern Europe, this extraordinary realm vanished from the map. But it became the cradle of what we now know as the Low Countries, modern Belgium and the Netherlands. This is the story of a thousand years, a compulsively readable narrative history of ambitious aristocrats, family dysfunction, treachery, savage battles, luxury and madness. It is about the decline of knightly ideals and the awakening of individualism and of cities, the struggle for dominance in the heart of northern Europe, bloody military campaigns and fatally bad marriages. It is also a remarkable cultural history, of great art and architecture and music emerging despite the violence and the chaos of the tension between rival dynasties.",469,History,en,9781789543452,burgundians

Pagan Words and Christian Meanings,Richard North,Rodopi,1991,"An evolution of attitudes towards pre-Christian custom in , North-West Europe, as shown in early .medieval word-fields and texts in Old English and Old Icelandic literature, is represented in six variously focussed studies. The first three chapters, Pagan Words, form a network of research on pre-Christian concepts of mind and soul as they survived, still active, in Christianized heroic poetry. This was part of. the heathen matrix through which the first expressions of Christianity in Old English and Icelandic literature were possible. The second half of this book, Christian Meanings, shows .how the same Christian literature produced reinterpretations of paganism. The literary range stretches from the earliest epic formulae to the polished genealogical novels of thirteenth-century Iceland- An ancient tradition of augury is invoked by the poet of The Seafarerto illustrate a believer's passage to heaven. In Havamal, an artificially pagan creed of ritual teaching and responses is compiled in Iceland as an antiquarian entertainment, perhaps on a Christian model. The last chapter shows a variety of Christian interpretations of, paganism in four sagas of Icelanders from the early to late thirteenth century. Overall where paganism was concerned, the tendency was first to cast off a way of life, then later, when that life was lost forever, to reinvent it for the imagination.",216,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,9051833059,germanic paganism
When the Norns Have Spoken,Anthony Winterbourne,,2004-10-01,"This book argues that within Germanic paganism, considered not as mere cult but as a system of beliefs, it is possible to identify a conceptually coherent understanding of fate which detaches that idea from time, and connects it instead with an implicit theses about the nature of truth as written. Germanic cosmogony, as represented in such precise images as a world-tree, provides a context for an analysis of specific metaphors for the workings of fate as woven or spun by such figures as the Nornsthe Norse goddesses of destiny. Employing both philosophical and mythic-linguistic considerations, this book also offers new insights into the persistence of a residual paganism in the understanding of fate following the Christian conversion.",187,Philosophy,en,1611472962,germanic paganism

"The Hidden Pathways of Germanic Mythology On the Neglected, Demonized, Repulsed and Repressed Archetypical Representations of Original Germanic Culture",Paul Wassmann,Chiron Publications,2019-06-24,"In the context of the Indo-European cultures, this book offers an overview of the hidden pathways of Germanic Mythology, focusing upon the Germanic Word View, the creation of the world, the Dawn of Gods and the psychological role of some of the most significant gods and goddesses. The center of gravity is given to the relationship between the Germanic mythology, Christianity and humanistic education. It is revealed that the Germanic universe had a balanced worldview between patriarchal and matricentric gods and that the Norse people developed and cultivated some of today’s most highly held values such as democracy and individual and female rights. The book points at the considerable consequences of neglecting, demonizing, repulsing and repressing archetypical representations of the original Germanic culture, which was and still is considered barbarous and primitive. This creates momentous daggers for the resilience, diversity and wellbeing of our societies. It is shown that Odin’s fundamental act of divination, his voluntary hanging on the Word Tree, provided humanity with access to the collective unconsciousness and ego autonomization. Odin is thus the archetype of the therapist of the psychodynamic tradition. The book ends with a plea that advocates for increased archetypal literacy, looked at as roadmap to peace.",375,Psychology,en,9781630517144,germanic paganism
Imagining the Pagan Past Gods and Goddesses in Literature and History Since the Dark Ages,Marion Gibson,Routledge,2013,"Imagining the Pagan Past explores stories of Britain’s pagan history. These tales have been characterised by gods and fairies, folklore and magic. They have had an uncomfortable relationship with the scholarly world; often being seen as historically dubious, self-indulgent romance and, worse, encouraging tribal and nationalistic feelings or challenging church and state. This book shows how important these stories are to the history of British culture, taking the reader on a lively tour from prehistory to the present. From the Middle Ages to the twenty-first century, Marion Gibson explores the ways in which British pagan gods and goddesses have been represented in poetry, novels, plays, chronicles, scientific and scholarly writing. From Geoffrey of Monmouth to Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare to Seamus Heaney and H.G. Wells to Naomi Mitchison it explores Romano-British, Celtic and Anglo-Saxon deities and fictions. The result is a comprehensive picture of the ways in which writers have peopled the British pagan pantheons throughout history. Imagining the Pagan Past will be essential reading for all those interested in the history of paganism.",265,History,en,9780415674188,germanic paganism

Becoming Historical Cultural Reformation and Public Memory in Early Nineteenth-Century Berlin,John Edward Toews,Cambridge University Press,2004-08-16,"This book examines the ways in which selfhood and cultural solidarity came to be understood and lived as historical identities during the first half of the nineteenth century. It's focus is on the Prussian capital- Berlin- and on the remarkable groups of artists and thinkers- Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Felix Mendelssohn, Jacob Grimm, Friedrich Karl von Savigny and Leopold von Ranke-who became associated in 1840 with the cultural agenda of a regime that hoped to forge solidarity among its subjects by encouraging identification with a constructed public memory.

Barbarian Rites The Spiritual World of the Vikings and the Germanic Tribes,Hans-Peter Hasenfratz,Simon and Schuster,2011-06-23,"Discover the untamed paganism of the Vikings and the Germanic tribes prior to the complete Christianization of Europe • Explores the different forms of magic practiced by these tribes, including runic magic, necromancy (death magic), soul-travel, and shape-shifting • Examines their rites of passage and initiation rituals and their most important gods, such as Odin, Loki, and Thor • Looks at barbarian magic in historical accounts, church and assembly records, and mythology as well as an eyewitness report from a 10th-century Muslim diplomat • Reveals the use and abuse of this tradition’s myths and magic by the Nazis Before the conversion of Europe to Christianity in the Middle Ages, Germanic tribes roamed the continent, plundering villages and waging battles to seek the favor of Odin, their god of war, ecstasy, and magic. Centuries later, predatory Viking raiders from Scandinavia carried on similar traditions. These wild “barbarians” had a system of social classes and familial clans with complex spiritual customs, from rites of passage for birth, death, and adulthood to black magic practices and shamanic ecstatic states, such as the infamous “berserker’s rage.” Chronicling the original pagan tradition of free and wild Europe--and the use and abuse of its myths and magic by the Nazis--Hans-Peter Hasenfratz offers a concise history of the Germanic tribes of Europe and their spiritual, magical, and occult beliefs. Looking at historical accounts, church and assembly records, mythology, and folktales from Germany, Russia, Scandinavia, and Iceland as well as an eyewitness report of Viking customs and rituals from a 10th-century Muslim diplomat, Hasenfratz explores the different forms of magic--including charms, runic magic, necromancy, love magic, soul-travel, and shamanic shape-shifting--practiced by the Teutonic tribes and examines their interactions with and eventual adaptation to Christianity. Providing in-depth information on their social class and clan structure, rites of passage, and their most important gods and goddesses, such as Odin, Loki, Thor, and Freyja, Hasenfratz reveals how it is only through understanding our magical barbarian roots that we can see the remnants of their language, culture, and dynamic spirit that have carried through to modern times.",171,Social Science,en,9781620554487,germanic paganism

Norse Revival Transformations of Germanic Neopaganism,Stefanie von Schnurbein,BRILL,2016-01-12,"Norse Revival offers a thorough investigation of Germanic Neopaganism (Asatru) through an international and comprehensive historical perspective. It traces Germanic Neopaganism’s genesis in German ultra-nationalist and occultist movements around 1900. Based on ethnographic research of contemporary groups in Germany, Scandinavia and North America, the book examines this alternative Neopagan religion’s transformations towards respectability and mainstream thought after the 1970s. It asks which regressive and progressive elements of a National Romantic discourse on Norse myth have shaped Germanic Neopaganism. It demonstrates how these ambiguous ideas about Nordic myth permeate general discourses on race, religion, gender, sexuality, and aesthetics. Ultimately, Norse Revival raises the question whether Norse mythology can be freed from its reactionary ideological baggage.",430,Religion,en,9789004309517,germanic paganism

The book is about kinship, but also, directly and indirectly, about other aspects of the period: law, association and social organization, family institutions and the barbarian and Roman heritage of the early Middle Ages. It is its principal aim that from a re-examination of kinship will come a greater understanding of some of the central documents of barbarian social and legal history.",284,History,en,,germanic paganism

This volume examines the discursive strategies these authors used to describe, distort, and redefine pre-Christian Slavic religion. Through over a dozen case studies, the author explores texts, archaeological evidence, and ethnographic data that reveal how Christianity attempted to reframe pagan traditions.

"Cosmopolitanism, Nationalism, and Modern Paganism",Kathryn Rountree,Springer,2016-12-10,"This volume explores how Pagans negotiate local and global tensions as they craft their identities, both as members of local communities and as cosmopolitan “citizens of the world.” Based on cutting edge international case studies from Pagan communities in the United States, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Malta, it considers how modern Pagans negotiate tensions between the particular and universal, nationalism and cosmopolitanism, ethnicity, and world citizenship. The burgeoning of modern Paganisms in recent decades has proceeded alongside growing globalization and human mobility, ubiquitous Internet use, a mounting environmental crisis, the re-valuing of indigenous religions, and new political configurations. Cosmopolitanism and nationalism have both influenced the weaving of unique local Paganisms in diverse contexts. Pagans articulate a strong attachment to local or indigenous traditions and landscapes, constructing paths that reflect local socio-cultural, political, and historical realities. However, they draw on the Internet and the global circulation of people and universal ideas. This collection considers how they confound these binaries in fascinating, complex ways as members of local communities and global networks.",283,Religion,en,9781137562005,slavic paganism
"The Post-Soviet Politics of Utopia Language, Fiction and Fantasy in Modern Russia","Mikhail Suslov, Per-Arne Bodin",Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-09-19,"More than 700 'utopian' novels are published in Russia every year. These utopias – meaning here fantasy fiction, science fiction, space operas or alternative history – do not set out merely to titillate; instead they express very real Russian anxieties: be they territorial right-sizing, loss of imperial status or turning into a 'colony' of the West. Contributors to this innovative collection use these narratives to re-examine post-Soviet Russian political culture and identity. Interrogating the intersections of politics, ideologies and fantasies, chapters draw together the highbrow literary mainstream (authors such as Vladimir Sorokin), mass literature for entertainment and individuals who bridge the gap between fiction writers and intellectuals or ideologists (Aleksandr Prokhanov, for example, the editor-in-chief of Russia's far-right newspaper Zavtra). In the process The Post-Soviet Politics of Utopia sheds crucial light onto a variety of debates – including the rise of nationalism, right-wing populism, imperial revanchism, the complicated presence of religion in the public sphere, the function of language – and is important reading for anyone interested in the heightened importance of ideas, myths, alternative histories and conspiracy theories in Russia today.",281,Political Science,en,9781788317054,slavic paganism

Russian Neo-pagan Myths and Antisemitism,Viktor Aleksandrovich Shnirelʹman,,1998,"Neopaganism is a conspicuous branch of contemporary Russian nationalism, finding its expression in a number of extremist organizations and periodicals. It adopted the Aryan myth (usually identifying Aryans with ancient Slavs). The ideology of extremist racism mixes Russian nationalism and mysticism. Neopagans present early and modern history as a Manichaean conflict between good Aryans and evil Jews who are seeking to subjugate the world. Christianity is seen as the main evil entity brought by the Jews into the Aryan world. The Bolshevik Revolution is said to be the result of a Jewish plot. The neopagans have produced mystical pseudo-historical literature which has had some popular success. Dwells on the ideologies of the Union of Veneds, the Vedic movement, and some other groups, as well as of such authors as Valerii Yemelyanov, Yurii Nikitin, Vladimir and Dmitrii Kandyba, and Viktor Bezverkhii.

Slavic Paganism Today Between Ideas and Practice,Roman Shizhensky,,2021-03-15,"Since the late years of the USSR, a new religious movement has gained momentum in Russia which seeks to return to the ancient faith of the Slavic peoples and to revive the pagan traditions that once embraced vast expanses of Eurasia. The Rodnoverie or ""Native Faith"" movement has emerged as a constellation of diverse religio-spiritual, philosophical, socio-cultural, and political currents whose identities and dynamics have continued to draw attention within the religious landscape of the post-Soviet space.

The rituals, myths and narratives of pre-Christian Scandinavia are investigated and interpreted by archaeologists, historians, art historians, historians of religion as well as scholars of literature, onomastics and Scandinavian studies. For obvious reasons, these studies belong to the main curricula in Scandinavia but are also carried out at many other universities in Europe, the United States and Australia a fact that is evident to any reader of this book. In order to bring this broad and varied field of research together, an international conference on Old Norse religion was held in Lund in June 2004. About two hundred delegates from more than fifteen countries took part. The intention was to gather researchers to encourage and improve scholarly exchange and dialogue, and Old Norse religion in long-term perspectives presents a selection of the proceedings from that conference. The 75 contributions elucidate topics such as worldview and cosmology, ritual and religious practice, myth and memory as well as the reception and present-day use of Old Norse religion.

Myths of the Pagan North The Gods of the Norsemen,Christopher Abram,Bloomsbury Publishing,2011-03-03,"As the Vikings began to migrate overseas as raiders or settlers in the late eighth century, there is evidence that this new way of life, centred on warfare, commerce and exploration, brought with it a warrior ethos that gradually became codified in the Viking myths, notably in the cult of Odin, the god of war, magic and poetry, and chief god in the Norse pantheon. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when most of Scandinavia had long since been converted to Christianity, form perhaps the most important era in the history of Norse mythology: only at this point were the myths of Thor, Freyr and Odin first recorded in written form. Using archaeological sources to take us further back in time than any written document, the accounts of foreign writers like the Roman historian Tacitus, and the most important repository of stories of the gods, old Norse poetry and the Edda, Christopher Abram leads the reader into the lost world of the Norse gods.",274,History,en,9781441102003,norse paganism

The Conqueror's Gift Roman Ethnography and the End of Antiquity,Michael Maas,Princeton University Press,2025-02-25,"The essential role of ethnographic thought in the Roman empire and how it evolved in Late Antiquity Ethnography is indispensable for every empire, as important as armies, tax collectors, or ambassadors. It helps rulers articulate cultural differences, and it lets the inhabitants of the empire, especially those who guide its course, understand themselves in the midst of enemies, allies, and friends. In The Conqueror’s Gift, Michael Maas examines the ethnographic infrastructure of the Roman Empire and the transformation of Rome’s ethnographic vision during Late Antiquity. Drawing on a wide range of texts, Maas shows how the Romans’ ethnographic thought evolved as they attended to the business of ruling an empire on three continents. Ethnography, the “conqueror’s gift,” gave Romans structured ways of finding a place for foreigners in the imperial worldview and helped justify imperial action affecting them. In Late Antiquity, Christianity revolutionized the imperial ethnographic infrastructure by altering old concepts and introducing credal models of community. The Bible became a source for organizing the Roman world. At the same time, many previously unseen collective identities emerged across Western Eurasia in reaction to the diminution of Roman power. These changes deeply affected the Empire’s ethnographic infrastructure and vision of the world. Maas argues that a major consequence of these developments was the beginning of a sectarian age, as individuals and political communities came to identify themselves primarily in terms of religion as well as ethnicity. As they adjusted to changing ethnographic realities, Romans understood their place among the peoples of the world in new ways. Willingly or not, we continue to be recipients of the conqueror’s gift today.",456,History,en,9780691259048,foederati

Rude Britannia,Mina Gorji,Routledge,2013-04-15,"Media commentators have noted a rising public tolerance to the use of rude or offensive words in modern English. John Lydon’s obscene outburst on 'I’m a Celebrity...' only provoked a handful of complaints – a muted reaction compared to the furore following his use of the f-word on television twenty-eight years earlier. This timely and authoritative exploration of rudeness in modern English draws together experts from the academic world and the media – journalists, linguists, lexicographers and literary critics – and argues that rudeness is an important cultural phenomenon. Tightly edited with clear accessibly written pieces, the essays look at rudeness in: the media literature football chants street culture seaside postcards. With contributions from media figures including Tom Paulin and leading media-friendly linguists Deborah Cameron and Lynda Mugglestone, Rude Britannia raises concerns about linguistic and social codes, standards of decency, what is considered taboo in the public realm, constructions of bawdy, class, race, power and British identity.",152,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,9781136009983,britannia

A History of the Alans in the West,Bernard S. Bachrach,U of Minnesota Press,1973-07-25,"A History of the Alans in the West was first published in 1973. Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. The Alans, a nomadic people from the steppe lands of south Russia, were among the many invaders of the Roman empire who helped to bring about its fall. Unlike the majority of the invaders, they were not Germans — they were Indo-Iranians—and they were not, like most barbarians, organized in agricultural communities. This history traces their westward movement from the time of their first mention in sources of classical antiquity through the early Middle Ages. Professor Bachrach discusses the social and religious institutions of the Alans and especially their military customs. As he shows, they contributed much to the military repertoire of the West, especially the feigned retreat tactic and the role of the cavalry as the primary part of the army. In their westward movement the Alans were assimilated by people in Gaul and Italy and served the empire in a military capacity during the fourth and fifth centuries. IN addition to their military and political impact in several areas, the Alans also influenced early medieval artistic styles, literary developments, place names, and personal names. A number of illustrations provide examples of the artistic influence of the Alans, and there are maps pertinent to the history.",187,History,en,9780816656998,alans

The Hoodsman - Frisians of the Fens Book Three in the Series by Skye Smith,Skye Smith,Skye Smith,2019-04-10,"Cover Flap In the first two books in this series, the young porter, Raynar, survived the battles of 1066 first at Stamford bridge and then at Hastings road. In this third book, the year is 1067, and he is spreading the word that the Normans are coming to all of the small villages in the Fens of Lincolnshire. Towards the Wash from Hereward's town of Bourne, he helps some Frisian axemen rescue their village from the Sheriff's men, and after he is injured, he is nursed back to health by the village women. Nursed by the tall, slender, fair, wonderful, and totally self assured Frisian women. Of course he falls in love. In the first two books the elder Raynar completely got away with killing King William Rufus in 1100. In this third book, he must deal with the news that the new King Henry, the son of his worst enemy, plans to marry the daughter of his old friend and lover. About the Author Skye Smith is my pen name. My ancestors were miners and shepherds near Castleton in the Peaks District of Derbyshire. I have been told by some readers that this series reminds them of Bernard Cornwell’s historical novels, and have always been delighted by the comparison. This is the third of my Hoodsman series of books, and you should read the first “Killing Kings” before you read this book. All of the books contain two timelines linked by characters and places. The “current” story is set in the era of King Henry I in the 1100’s, while the longer “flashback” story is set in the era of King William I after 1066. I have self-published twelve “The Hoodsman” historical-adventure novels and one Companion reference book for the series: # - SubTitle William I Timeline Henry I Timeline 1.

Frisians and Their North Sea Neighbours From the Fifth Century to the Viking Age,"John Hines, Nelleke IJssennagger",Boydell & Brewer,2017,"La 4e de couv. indique : ""As early as the 1st century AD, learned Romans knew of more than one group of people living in north-western Europe beyond their Empire's Gallic provinces whose names contained the element that gives us modern ""Frisian"". Those apparently were Celtic-speaking peoples, but that population seems to have completely replaced in the course of the convulsions that Europe underwent at the transition from the Ancient world to the Early Medieval in the 4th and 5th centuries. The importance of linguistically Germanic Frisians as neighbours of the Anglo-Saxons, Franks, Saxons and Danes in the centuries immediately following the fall of the Roman Empire in the West is widely recognized, and yet these folk themselves remain enigmatic, and the details of their culture and organization unfamiliar to many. The Frisian population and their lands are the focal point of this volume, although, as is shown, we often have to approach and to understand these people through comparison with, or even through the eyes of, their neighbours. Empirically, this perspective embraces all of the coastal communities of the North Sea region, and their connexions with the Baltic shores. Twelve separate but complementary papers present the most up-to-date discoveries, research and interpretations, following the story of the various Frisians through from the Roman Period to the next great period of disruption and change introduced by the Viking Scandinavians.

The Genesis of the Turks An Ethno-Linguistic Inquiry into the Prehistory of Central Eurasia,Osman Karatay,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2022-01-25,"This book suggests a new theory on the origins and Urheimat of the Turks within the context of Central Eurasia and, more properly, the South Urals, by exploring the relations of the Turkic language with the Altaic, Uralic and Indo-European languages and by referring to historical, genetic and archaeological sources. The book shows that the elements that started the making of the Turkic ethno-linguistic entity were also shared by the regions where the later Hungarians would emerge, and that the consolidation of their identity seems to be related to the emergence and rise of the Sintashta culture. It argues that the fertile lands and suitable climatic conditions, together with the coming of agriculture likely at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, allowed them to increase their population.",539,History,en,9781527578814,sarmatians

"The Golden Deer of Eurasia Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures from the Russian Steppes : the State Hermitage, Saint Petersburg, and the Archaeological Museum, Ufa","Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.)",Metropolitan Museum of Art,2000,"Spectacular works of art were excavated between 1986 and 1990 from burial mounds at Filippovka, in Russia, on the border of Europe and Asia. The objects were created from about the fifth to the fourth century B.C. by pastoral people who lived on the steppes near the southern Ural Mountains. The large funerary deposits include wooden, deerlike creatures with predatory mouths and elongated snouts and ears, overlaid with sheets of gold and silver, as well as gold attachments for wooden vessels and gold and silver luxury wares imported from Achaemenid Iran. These treasures are now in the collection of the Archaeological Museum, Ufa, in the Russian republic of Bashkortostan. The discoveries at Filippovka open a new chapter in the history of the material culture of the nomads who in the first millennium B.C. traversed the steppe corridor extending from the Black Sea region to China. Yet the information provided by the Filippovka excavations is complicated and ambiguous. The identity of the people represented by the finds remains uncertain, but the forms and ornamentation of many works from Filippovka, as well as the cemetery's location in the southern Urals, argue for the cultural-chronological designation of this material as Early Sarmatian. Stylistic features, however, point also to the arts of Siberia, Central Asia, and China in the east and to the art of the ""Meotian-Scythians"" in the west. Imported Achaemenid goods raise questions about their place of production and about the circumstances that brought them to be included in tombs on the southern Ural steppes. Finally, robbers penetrated the burials in antiquity, destroying much of the evidence necessary for understanding the Filippovka nomads' religious and funerary practices. These are among the issues addressed in this volume, the catalogue for an exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art that brings together the remarkable new material from Filippovka and, from the incomparably rich collections of the State Hermitage, Saint Petersburg, related luxury objects found in graves of other Eurasian steppe tribes. Gold and silver objects from the Scythian Black Sea tombs; textiles and leather and wooden works from the Altai Mountains; and gold and bronze pieces from the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Siberia illustrate developments in the art of the steppes in the centuries preceding the Filippovka burials, in contemporary societies, and in later centuries, toward the turn of the first millennium B.C. These outstanding works not only place the Filippovka discoveries in their proper historical and cultural context but are themselves fascinating and enigmatic.",325,Art,en,9780870999598,sarmatians
Sarmatians and Scythians The Nomadic Tribes during the Roman Era,Kelly Mass,Efalon Acies,,"Throughout the vast steppes of Eurasia, two fierce and mobile peoples once thundered across the landscape, shaping the history and mythologies of the ancient world: the Scythians and the Sarmatians. These nomadic tribes lived on horseback, fought in swift raids, and maintained a culture and lifestyle uniquely adapted to the wide-open grasslands. As they moved across the steppe, they clashed with empires, including the powerful Romans. Their legacy can be seen not only in the ruins and writings of antiquity but also in the folklore and warrior traditions of later European peoples. This book provides a concise exploration into who these people were, how they lived, and how they interacted with the Roman world. The Scythians were among the earliest identifiable groups of Iranian-speaking nomads to dominate the Eurasian steppes. Emerging around the 9th century BCE, they occupied a vast territory that included parts of modern-day Ukraine, southern Russia, and Central Asia. Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian, described them in detail—depicting a warrior culture that revered archery, honored the dead with great burial mounds, and held elaborate rituals involving horses and fire. The Scythians were not an empire in the traditional sense but rather a loosely organized collection of tribes united by similar customs, languages, and economic patterns. They were masters of horseback warfare and developed advanced forms of mounted archery and cavalry tactics long before such strategies became common elsewhere. Their success in warfare allowed them to control vital trade routes between East and West, collecting tribute from weaker neighboring peoples and sometimes engaging in brutal raids.",19,History,en,,sarmatians

Cunningham,Cambridge University Press,2022-09-08,"The Virgin Mary assumed a position of central importance in Byzantium. This major and authoritative study examines her portrayal in liturgical texts during the first six centuries of Byzantine history. Focusing on three main literary genres that celebrated this holy figure, it highlights the ways in which writers adapted their messages for different audiences. Mary is portrayed variously as defender of the imperial city, Constantinople, virginal Mother of God, and ascetic disciple of Christ. Preachers, hymnographers, and hagiographers used rhetoric to enhance Mary's powerful status in Eastern Christian society, depicting her as virgin and mother, warrior and ascetic, human and semi-divine being. Their paradoxical statements were based on the fundamental mystery that Mary embodied: she was the mother of Christ, the Word of God, who provided him with the human nature that he assumed in his incarnation.

"Dreams and Divination from Byzantium to Baghdad, 400-1000 CE",Bronwen Neil,Oxford University Press,2021-01-14,"Why did dreams matter to Jews, Byzantine Christians, and Muslims in the first millennium? Dreams and Divination from Byzantium to Baghdad, 400 - 1000 CE shows how the ability to interpret dreams universally attracted power and influence in the first millennium. In a time when prophetic dreams were viewed as God's intervention in human history, male and female prophets wielded was unparalleled power in imperial courts, military camps, and religious gatherings. The three faiths drew on the ancient Near Eastern tradition of dream key manuals, which offer an insight into the hopes and fears of ordinary people. They melded pagan dream divination with their own scriptural traditions to produce a novel and rich culture of dream interpretation. Prophetic dreams enabled communities to understand their past and present circumstances as divinely ordained and helped to bolster the spiritual authority of dreamers and those who had the gift of interpreting their dreams. Bronwen Neil takes a gendered approach to the analysis of the common culture of dream interpretation across late antique Jewish, Byzantine, and Islamic sources to 1000 CE, in order to expose the ways in which dreams offered women a unique opportunity to exercise influence. The epilogue to the volume reveals why dreams still matter today to many men and women of the monotheist traditions.",255,Religion,en,9780192644527,period 400-1000

Late Roman Spain and Its Cities,Michael Kulikowski,JHU Press,2004-10,"Winner of an Honorable Mention in the Association of American Publishers’ Professional and Scholarly Publishing Awards in Classics and Archeology The history of Spain in late antiquity offers important insights into the dissolution of the western Roman empire and the emergence of medieval Europe. Nonetheless, scholarship on Spain in this period has lagged behind that on other Roman provinces. Michael Kulikowski draws on the most recent archeological and literary evidence to integrate late antique Spain into the broader history of the Roman empire, providing a definitive narrative and analytical account of the Iberian peninsula from A.D. 300 to 600. Kulikowski begins with a concise introduction to the early history of Roman Spain, and then turns to the Diocletianic reforms of 293 and their long-term implications for Roman administration and the political ambitions of post-Roman contenders. He goes on to examine the settlement of barbarian peoples in Spain, the end of Roman rule, and the imposition of Gothic power in the fifth and sixth centuries. In parallel to this narrative account, Kulikowski offers a wide-ranging thematic history, focusing on political power, Christianity, and urbanism. Kulikowski's portrait of late Roman Spain offers some surprising conclusions. With new archeological evidence and a fresh interpretation of well-known literary sources, Kulikowski contradicts earlier assertions of a catastrophic decline of urbanism, finding that the physical and social world of the Roman city continued well into the sixth century despite the decline of Roman power. This groundbreaking study will prompt further reassessments of the other Roman provinces and of medieval Spanish history.",528,History,en,0801879787,late roman empire

Beginning from the Great Persecution of Diocletian and the conversion of Constantine the first Christian Roman emperor, the volume explores Christianity's rise as the dominant religion of the Later Roman empire and how the Church survived the decline and fall of Roman power in the west and converted the Germanic tribes who swept into the western empire. These years of crisis and transformation inspired generations of great writers, among them Eusebius of Caesarea, Ammianus Marcellinus, Julian 'the Apostate', Ambrose of Milan, John Chrysostom, Jerome and Augustine of Hippo. They were also years which saw Christianity face huge challenges on many crucial questions, from the evolution of Christian doctrine and the rise of asceticism to the place of women in the early Church and the emerging relationship between Church and state.

Rome and Constantinople Rewriting Roman History During Late Antiquity,Raymond Van Dam,,2010,"Imperial Rome and Christian Constantinople were both astonishingly large cities with over-sized appetites that served as potent symbols of the Roman Empire and its rulers. Esteemed historian Raymond Van Dam draws upon a wide array of evidence to reveal a deep interdependence on imperial ideology and economy as he elucidates the parallel workaday realities and lofty images in their stories. Tracing the arc of empire from the Rome of Augustus to Justinian's Constantinople, he masterfully shows how the changing political structures, ideologies, and historical narratives of Old and New Rome always remained rooted in the bedrock of the ancient Mediterranean's economic and demographic realities. The transformations in the Late Roman Empire, brought about by the rise of the military and the church, required a rewriting of the master narrative of history and signaled changes in economic systems. Just as Old Rome had provided a stage set for the performance of Republican emperorship, New Rome was configured for the celebration of Christian rule. As it came to pass, a city with too much history was outshone by a city with no history. Provided with the urban amenities and an imagined history appropriate to its elevated status, Constantinople could thus resonate as the new imperial capital, while Rome, on the other hand, was reinvented as the papal city.",120,Business & Economics,en,,late roman empire

Echoes of the Roman Empire,Pasquale De Marco,Pasquale De Marco,2025-07-16,"In the annals of history, few civilizations have left as profound a mark on the world as the Roman Empire. Its influence extends far beyond the boundaries of time, shaping the course of Western civilization and leaving an enduring legacy that continues to resonate today. This comprehensive book delves into the multifaceted tapestry of Roman history, offering a captivating exploration of the empire's rise, its zenith, and its eventual decline. Through the writings of ancient historians, poets, and philosophers, we are transported back in time to witness the triumphs and tribulations of this extraordinary civilization. We encounter iconic figures such as Julius Caesar, Augustus, Constantine, and Justinian, each leaving their unique imprint on the course of Roman history. We also encounter ordinary men and women, whose lives and experiences offer glimpses into the everyday realities of Roman society. From the intricate legal systems that govern our societies to the architectural wonders that grace our cities, the Roman Empire's legacy is everywhere. This book explores the enduring influence of Roman law, the advances made in engineering and architecture, and the contributions to medicine and the arts. But the Roman Empire was also a complex and often contradictory civilization. It was a place of both great innovation and profound inequality. It was a society that embraced both republican ideals and imperial rule. And it was an empire that ultimately succumbed to the forces of division and decline. By delving into the depths of Roman history, we gain a deeper understanding of our own world, the challenges we face, and the aspirations we hold for the future. **Echoes of the Roman Empire** is an essential read for anyone interested in history, culture, and the enduring legacy of one of the world's greatest civilizations.

"Emerging Powers in Eurasian Comparison, 200–1100 Shadows of Empire",,BRILL,2022-11-07,"This book compares the ways in which new powers arose in the shadows of the Roman Empire and its Byzantine and Carolingian successors, of Iran, the Caliphate and China in the first millennium CE. These new powers were often established by external military elites who had served the empire. They remained in an uneasy balance with the remaining empire, could eventually replace it, or be drawn into the imperial sphere again. Some relied on dynastic legitimacy, others on ethnic identification, while most of them sought imperial legitimation. Across Eurasia, their dynamic was similar in many respects; why were the outcomes so different? Contributors are Alexander Beihammer, Maaike van Berkel, Francesco Borri, Andrew Chittick, Michael R.

The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God The Arian Controversy 318-381 AD,"Richard Patrick Crosland Hanson, R. P. Hanson",A&C Black,2005-01-01,"First published in 1988, The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God is still considered by many scholars to be the finest work on the Arian Controversy. Examining scholarly works on the Controversy and many original texts, Professor Hanson, provides a clear understanding of how the traditional and historic doctrine of God as the Holy Trinity reached its most mature and enduring form. The author is not primarily concerned to defend the orthodox position itself, but rather to discover and examine the formation of that orthodoxy. The history of the events - the Councils, the interventions of the Emperor, the rivalries of sees, the behaviour of bishops, the varying fortunes of the different schools of thought and their leaders - is interwoven with the progression of thought and doctrine during the sixty years of the Controversy. Professor Hanson sees the problem of the reconciliation of two concepts which were both part of the very fabric of Christianity - monotheism and the worship of Jesus Christ as divine.",966,Religion,en,056703092X,arianism

Archetypal Heresy Arianism Through the Centuries,Maurice Wiles,OUP Oxford,1996-08-08,"Arianism has always been regarded as the archetypal heresy. It did affirm the divinity of Christ as the Son of God, but, unlike orthodoxy, it regarded the divinity as secondary and inferior to that of the Father, the one supreme God. Recently many scholars have presented a more positive view of the religious intentions of Arianism than has been customary in the past. Yet the Nicene Creed, which was designed explicitly to outlaw Arianism, remains one of the primary expressions of Christian orthodoxy. Maurice Wiles traces the history of how Arianism has been viewed in later Christian thought, particularly where scholars or religious groups have adopted broadly Arian views. The main example of a re-emergence of Arian ideas is among the leaders of new scientific Englightenment in the early eighteenth century, especially Sir Isaac Newton and his disciples, William Whiston and Samuel Clarke. The longest section of the book deals with how and why their beliefs took this form, and why this approach disappeared again around the end of the century. A final section considers the interaction of belief and cricital judgement in British Arian scholarship during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.",215,Religion,en,9780191520594,arianism

History of the Arians,Athanasius of Alexandria,CreateSpace,2013-06-19,"Arianism is the theological teaching attributed to Arius (ca. AD 250–336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt, concerning the relationship of God to the Son of God (Jesus of Nazareth). Arius asserted that the Son of God was a subordinate entity to God the Father. Deemed a heretic by the Ecumenical First Council of Nicaea of 325, Arius was later exonerated in 335 at the regional First Synod of Tyre, and then, after his death, pronounced a heretic again at the Ecumenical First Council of Constantinople of 381.Athanasius of Alexandria (b. ca. 296-298 – d. 2 May 373), also referred to as St. Athanasius the Great, St. Athanasius I of Alexandria, St Athanasius the Confessor and (primarily in the Coptic Orthodox Church) St Athanasius the Apostolic, was the 20th bishop of Alexandria. His episcopate lasted 45 years (c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373), of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different Roman emperors. He is considered to be a renowned Christian theologian, a Church Father, the chief defender of Trinitarianism against Arianism, and a noted Egyptian leader of the fourth century.",174,Religion,en,1490479724,arianism
The Arian Controversy,Henry M. Gwatkin,Wipf and Stock Publishers,2001-06-13,"Arianism is extinct only in the sense that it has long ceased to furnish party names. It sprang from permanent tendencies of human nature, and raised questions whose interest can never perish. As long as the Agnostic and the Evolutionist are with us, the old battlefields of Athanasius will not be left to silence. Moreover, no writer more directly joins the new world of Teutonic Christianity with the old of Greek and Roman heathenism. Arianism began its career partly as a theory of Christianity, partly as an Eastern reaction of philosophy against a gospel of the Son of God. Through sixty years of ups and downs and stormy controversy it fought, and not without success, for the dominion of the world. When it was at last rejected by the Empire, it fell back upon its converts among the Northern nations, and renewed the contest as a Western reaction of Teutonic pride against a Roman gospel.",187,Religion,en,9781579106645,arianism
The Arian Christian Doctrines The Origins of Christianity,"Charles D Levy MM, Institute for Metaphysical Studies, Institute for Metaphysical Studies Inc",Metaphysical Institute,2010-08-30,"The word 'Arian' should not be confused with the word 'Aryan', which is derived from Hindu philosophy and was inaccurately used by the German, NAZI party as the basis for its racist and anti-Semitic philosophy. The word 'Arian' was derived from the name of Saint Arius of Alexandria (in Egypt). Although the word was derived from the name of St Arius, the word 'Arian"" was coined by the Catholic Church as a pejorative name designed to define the heresy of those Christians who did not accept the Roman Catholic concept of the Holy Trinity and the divinity of Jesus. The term was used against those who would think for themselves. This book is an attempt to right the record and bring back to Christianity the broad range of views that prevailed before the Romans co-opted the Christian Religion and turned it into a political arm of the Roman Empire. How does a person know if he or she is an Arian Christian or not? If you have ever asked the question, ""What would Jesus do?"" you are probably an Arian Christian. Why would a person ask what Jesus would do as a personal guide, if they believed that Jesus was God? Who would ask what God would do as a resolution to a personal problem when ordinary people do not have the powers of gods? Are you an Atheist or a person with secular views who accepts the Golden Rule of 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you' as a moral guide? Do you accept Jesus' moral, philosophical, guidelines without all the 'hocus pocus'? Do you consider yourself 'not' a Christian because others say that you are not? It shouldn't matter, because it did not matter to Jesus.",162,Religion,en,9781453764619,arianism
The Arian Controversy,Henry Melvill Gwatkin,DigiCat,2022-08-01,"In ""The Arian Controversy,"" Henry Melvill Gwatkin meticulously examines one of the most pivotal theological debates of early Christianity. His scholarly work delves into the intricate arguments surrounding Arianism, which challenged the orthodox view of the nature of Christ, asserting that the Son was a subordinate entity to God the Father. Gwatkin employs a blend of historical analysis and philosophical inquiry, presenting a narrative rich in patristic literature and ecclesiastical history. He contextualizes the controversy within the broader struggles of the early Church, effectively illuminating the socio-political ramifications of these theological disagreements. Gwatkin, a prominent historian and theologian of the late 19th century, possessed a profound insight into early Christian doctrine, shaped by his own academic journey at institutions such as Cambridge. His deep engagement with patristic texts and keen understanding of the Church's evolution inform this work, resulting in a scholarly yet accessible examination of how Arianism prompted key developments in Christian orthodoxy. Recommended for theologians, historians, and lay readers alike, ""The Arian Controversy"" serves not only as a critical resource for understanding early Christian disputes but also as an invitation to explore the enduring implications of these debates on contemporary faith. Gwatkin's rigorous scholarship will enrich any library, fostering deeper comprehension of the complexities within early Christian thought.",152,Religion,en,,arianism

The Waning of the Umayyad Caliphate,Aṭ-Ṭabarī,"Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.",1989,"The years 738-745/121-127, which this volume covers, saw the outbreak in Syria of savage internecine struggles between prominent members of the Umayyad family, which had ruled the Islamic world since 661/41. After the death of the caliph Hisham in 743-/125, the process of decay at the center of the Umayyad power--the ruling family itself--was swift and devastating. Three Umayyad caliphs (al-Walid II, Yazid III, and Ibrahim) followed Hisham within little more than a year, and the subsequent intervention of their distant cousin Marwan b. Muhammad (the future Marwan II) could not arrest the forces of opposition that were shortly to culminate in the 'Abbasid Revolution of 750/132. In this volume al-Tabari deals extensively with the end of Hisham's reign, providing a rich store of anecdotes on this most able of Umayyad caliphs.

This report is the sixth and final volume of the Meiron Excavation Project. The discovery in 1981 of the pediment of a Holy Ark from the Nabratein synagogue coincided with the release of the film Raiders of the Lost Ark. That coincidence brought much unanticipated press coverage to the expedition and its senior staff, even though we insisted that the discovery of perhaps the earliest synagogue ark was not to be identified with the recovery of the biblical Ark of the Covenant. Although the media attention was totally unexpected, we all did our best to respond to the occasion with honesty and a bit of whimsy. Such coverage of the Nabratein excavation resulted in making many more people interested in archaeology, even if it didn't solve a biblical mystery.

To answer these questions the archaeology of twenty-six towns is investigated. The towns selected are in regional groups (the Negev, Eastern Galilee and the Mediterranean coast) to illustrate different aspects of urban development from the Muslim conquest to the first century of Ottoman rule.

The Umayyad Caliphate The History and Legacy of the Second Islamic Kingdom Established After Muhammad's Death,,,2020-05-04,"*Includes pictures *Includes a bibliography for further reading The split between the two forms of Islam was already in the process of forming upon the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Muhammad had constructed around himself not only a potent new religious movement but also a powerful young state called the Ummah (the ""Community"" for lack of a better translation). Belonging to the Islamic faith also meant belonging to the Ummah, which was governed by its own laws and had many of its own institutions. In his own lifetime, Muhammad had ruled the Ummah through what sociologists call ""charismatic authority,"" a term coined by Max Weber that is defined as ""resting on devotion to the exceptional sanctity, heroism or exemplary character of an individual person, and of the normative patterns or order revealed or ordained by him."" Hence, Muslims believe Muhammad ruled because he was uniquely chosen and endowed by God as the exemplar of all humanity, giving him a unique (though not perfect or infallible) ability to govern humanity. This was a holistic form of governance because the Prophet did not simply deliver God's words (what became the Holy Qur'an), nor did he simply pronounce upon court cases and create laws. He did all those things, but he also presented in his own person the embodiment of the best that humanity could aspire to. He was fully human, but the finest, most pious example that humans would ever produce. Amid the upheaval in the Islamic world following Muhammad's death, the Umayyad Caliphate lasted for less than a century, but in that time it managed to become one of the most influential of the major caliphates established following him. Its official existence was from 661-750, and the rulers were the male members of the Umayyad dynasty, roughly translated from Arabic as the ""Sons of Umayyah."" Its primary base of power was in Syria following the creation of a dynastic, hereditary rule headed by one of Syria's long-lasting governors, Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan. Like the other caliphates around that time, the Umayyads existed in a constant state of internal struggle and external conflict. Battles over succession, especially over which lineages possessed the more legitimate claim to power, plagued the early years of the caliphate in Syria. The most significant were the First Muslim Civil War in 661 and the Second Civil War in 680. The official right to become caliph passed between branches of the Umayyad clan, but Syria and Damascus continued to be the main seats of power even as the kingdom expanded to include the Iberian Peninsula, the Transoxiana, the Maghreb, and Sindh. The Umayyad Caliphate became renowned for being a center of authoritarian power, education, and cultural development. The population was multiethnic and consisted of local peoples conquered throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia, including regional Christians and Jews. At its greatest extent, the empire extended over an area of 4,300,000 sq. miles, with over 33,000,000 residents. It was one of the largest known empires in history, even considering modern developments, and a precursor to the Golden Age of Islam. It remains a subject of modern debate how to best understand the Umayyads, but there is no doubt they were one of the most influential of the early medieval empires and paved the way for future Islamic caliphates to wield impressive amounts of influence throughout the Middle East. The Umayyad Caliphate: The History and Legacy of the Second Islamic Kingdom Established After the Prophet's Death chronicles the caliphate's life and accomplishments, and the massive impact it left on the world. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Umayyad Caliphate like never before.",96,,en,9798643339571,umayyad

The Roman Empire The History and Legacy of the Ancient World’s Most Famous Empire from Julius Caesar to Its Collapse,"Charles River Editors,",Charles River Editors,2025-05-01,"The importance of Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus (or as he was known from birth, Gaius Octavius “Octavian” Thurinus) to the course of Western history is hard to overstate. His life, his rise to power, his political, and his social and military achievements all laid the foundations for the creation of an empire which would endure for almost five centuries, and whose traditions, laws, architecture and art continue to influence much of Europe and the world today. Octavian was the first true Roman Emperor, and the first man since the Etruscan Tarquins five centuries earlier to establish a successful hereditary ruling dynasty in what had been a proud Republic for over half a millennium. He was a canny strategist, an excellent orator, a fine writer, a generous patron of the arts and enthusiastic promoter of public works, but above all he was a master politician. Octavian’s great-uncle (and adoptive father) Julius Caesar was a great general, and his rival Mark Antony was a great soldier, but as a politician Octavian outmatched them all. Certainly, like all men, Octavian had his defects. Like many of the most successful politicians, he could connive, plot and prevaricate with the best of them, and he made full use of the emotional pull that his late beloved great-uncle had over the legions during the course of his rise to power. His justice was also famously heavy-handed, and he was not known for his mercy towards those he defeated in battle or marginalized political opponents. Yet despite all this, he still stands in bronze on Rome’s Via dei Fori Imperiali to this day, along with the likes of Caesar, Hadrian, Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, and he is forever immortalized in all Western calendars as the patron of the month of August, which was dedicated to him when he was deified, following his death, as Divus Augustus. Like his adoptive father before him, Octavian is one of those figures whom it is difficult to know exactly what to make of, because he appears, even at a distance, to be larger than life. Yet the amount of personal correspondence and contemporary writings penned by Octavian himself, as well as his friends, associates, and rivals, helps form a clear picture of the man behind the bronze statue. Indeed, he was the ruler who found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble. One of the most overlooked emperors was also one of the first, and he lived in chaotic times. Tiberius was born in 42 BCE, just as the Roman Republic was dissolving and a new Roman imperial power structure emerged under Octavian, who became Rome’s first emperor as Caesar Augustus. Tiberius’s life soon became caught up with Augustus’s as the emperor worked to found and establish a dynasty, but it is unclear if Tiberius ever really wanted to be part of Augustus’s plans or inherit imperial power - Tiberius was known as a man who schemed and planned, but he was also a scholar and showed a marked desire throughout his life to retreat and escape the demands of power. Partially due to this continual tension, Tiberius’s life is enigmatic in many ways. Tiberius championed the Republic and seemed to desire its return, yet his acceptance of imperial power and his reign solidified Rome’s transition to an empire. He was a skilled general who showed concern for the well-being of his troops, and he displayed a remarkable patience as a military tactician. After he rose to become emperor in 14 CE, he ruled for over 22 years, which would be the longest reign of a Roman emperor over the next 100 years, but he remained suspicious of everyone and eventually chose the wrong person to trust, being eventually misled and betrayed by a man whom he thought was his closest friend. When he finally died, aged and lonely, he had become so hated that crowds celebrated his death.",348,History,en,9781475332032,theodoric the great

Heaven on Earth The Lives and Legacies of the World's Greatest Cathedrals,Emma J. Wells,Bloomsbury Publishing,2022-09-01,"A glorious illustrated history of sixteen of the world's greatest cathedrals, interwoven with the extraordinary stories of the people who built them. 'An impeccable guide to the golden age of ecclesiastical architecture' The Times 'Vivid, colourful and absorbing' Dan Jones 'An epic ode to some of our most beautiful and beloved buildings' Helen Carr The emergence of the Gothic in twelfth-century France, an architectural style characterized by pointed arches, rib vaults, flying buttresses, large windows and elaborate tracery, triggered an explosion of cathedral-building across western Europe. It is this remarkable flowering of ecclesiastical architecture that forms the central core of Emma Wells's authoritative but accessible study of the golden age of the cathedral. Prefacing her account with the construction in the sixth century of the Hagia Sophia, the remarkable Christian cathedral of the eastern Roman empire, she goes on to chart the construction of a glittering sequence of iconic structures, including Saint-Denis, Notre-Dame, Canterbury, Chartres, Salisbury, York Minster and Florence's Duomo. More than architectural biographies, these are human stories of triumph and tragedy that take the reader from the chaotic atmosphere of the mason's yard to the cloisters of power. Together, they reveal how 1000 years of cathedral-building shaped modern Europe, and influenced art, culture and society around the world.",548,Architecture,en,9781788541930,medieval constantinople

So vast was the space enclosed with no apparent means of support that the dome seemed almost to float in the air...

Studies on Constantinople,Cyril A. Mango,Routledge,1993,"This volume is devoted to the history, monuments and topography of Byzantine Constantinople, and includes two specially written pieces, as well as up-dates to the studies reprinted. Many of the articles deal with the imperial constructions of the first centuries of the City's existence - for instance, the columns of Constantine and Justinian, the Mausoleum of the Holy Apostles and the churches of St Sophia, St John of Studius, and Sts Sergius and Bacchus - structures which provided the basic monumental framework around which Constantinople developed and its life was lived. In his reconstruction of these monuments and their history, Cyril Mango demonstrates how much can be achieved by combining the information gained from meticulous examination of the written sources, whether contemporary or from post-medieval travellers, with that provided by the surviving buildings themselves and the remains that have been excavated. Ce volume, voué Ã l'histoire, aux monuments et Ã la topographie de Constantinople la Byzantine, comprend deux études rédigées pour l'occasion, ainsi qu'une mise Ã jour des travaux qui y sont re-publiés.

A Book of Psalms from Eleventh-century Byzantium The Complex of Texts and Images in Vat. Gr. 752,"Barbara Crostini, Glenn Peers",Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana,2016,"""This collection of essays offers new and deeper perspectives on a relatively little-studied manuscript of the Greek Psalter at the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, codex Vaticanus graecus 752. As the title suggests, the perspective of the editors is an inter-disciplinary one. Thus, the volume covers three broad areas: the material aspects concerning the manuscript, the textual contents consisting of Psalms and their catena commentary, and the over two hundred images that illustrate the psalms. Barbara Crostini has been mainly responsible for Parts I-II, and Glenn Peers for Part III, and the writing of this introduction follows this basic division of tasks. Ultimately, however, the editors would like to see these parts not as divided, but as mutually integrated, each providing clues to the major unresolved issues of provenance and production of this codex. Thus, it is capturing the complexity of the interrelationship between these elements in the creation and use of the manuscript that remains our ideal aim.Consider Vat. gr. 752 as a particular edition of the sacred page. As such, it came about and first lived in a specific context. Grasping this reality, though a past and necessarily elusive one, is surely the historian's task,and his/her attempt at doing so is both limited and sharpened by the tools at his/her disposal. The first part of this volume is an attempt to address this historical context.""--",636,Antiques & Collectibles,en,,medieval constantinople

Barbarian Invasions,"Sabine Lorca, AI",Publifye AS,2025-03-21,"""""Barbarian Invasions"""" explores the significant role of migrations and invasions in the decline of ancient empires, offering a nuanced perspective on these transformative events. The book examines the catalysts of these migrations, such as socio-economic pressures and ecological factors, alongside the mechanics of invasion, including military tactics and cultural clashes. One intriguing insight is the lasting impact of cultural exchange and the redrawing of political boundaries following imperial collapse, challenging simplistic narratives of destruction. The book progresses chronologically and geographically, utilizing case studies like the Germanic migrations into the Roman Empire, the Hunnic invasions, and the Viking raids. It draws upon primary sources, archaeological evidence, and recent advances in climate science and genetic research to provide a comprehensive analysis. By adopting a thematic approach and comparing different empires and invaders, """"Barbarian Invasions"""" identifies common patterns and unique characteristics, offering a deeper understanding of the dynamics driving these historical events. This study moves beyond viewing barbarian invasions merely as destructive forces, instead highlighting their complex role in reshaping the geopolitical landscape and fostering cultural evolution. Understanding these events provides valuable insights into the fragility of political structures and the recurring patterns of conflict and societal transformation. This book is valuable to those interested in military history, world history, and the forces that have shaped ancient civilizations.",168,History,en,9788235233011,barbarian invasions
The Barbarian Invasions A Genealogy of the History of Art,Eric Michaud,MIT Press,2019-12-10,"How the history of art begins with the myth of the barbarian invasion—the romantic fragmentation of classical eternity. The history of art, argues Éric Michaud, begins with the romantic myth of the barbarian invasions. Viewed from the nineteenth century, the Germanic-led invasions of the Roman Empire in the fifth century became the gateway to modernity, seen not as a catastrophe but as a release from a period of stagnation, renewing Roman culture with fresh, northern blood—and with new art that was anti-Roman and anticlassical. Artifacts of art from then on would be considered as the natural product of “races” and “peoples” rather than the creation of individuals. The myth of the barbarian invasions achieved the fragmentation of classical eternity. This narrative, Michaud explains, inseparable from the formation of nation states and the rise of nationalism in Europe, was based on the dual premise of the homogeneity and continuity of peoples. Local and historical particularities became weapons aimed at classicism's universalism. The history of art linked its objects with racial groups—denouncing or praising certain qualities as “Latin” or “Germanic.” Thus the predominance of linear elements was thought to betray a southern origin, and the “painterly” a Germanic or northern source. Even today, Michaud points out, it is said that art best embodies the genius of peoples. In the globalized contemporary art market, the ethnic provenance of works—categorized, for example, as “African American,” “Latino,” or “Native American”—creates added value.

When the latter had once crossed the Rhine and the Danube, their ultimate victory was assured; the Empire was bound to fall, new social conditions were bound to arise. But what had corrupted and weakened a people that had been for so many centuries a model of discipline, virtue, and strength-a people that had conquered the world? Its corruption was a consequence, not a cause, and was the first symptom of the decline that had already begun. The Empire that Livy had seen bending beneath the burden of its own greatness could not last for ever. The Empire had brought into being that moral and civil unity of the ancient world which was a necessary preliminary towards the formation of nationalities. Nationalities, in fact, can neither live nor thrive unless so closely inter-related as to feel themselves members of the same family. But their rise put an end to the existence of that ancient world which recognised the absolute predominance of one civilisation alone, outside of which were only barbarians. Therefore while, on the one hand, and seen from afar, the fall of the Empire may appear an extraordinary, an unexpected event; on the other we are positively moved to amazement by the length of its duration. In fact, under one or another form, we witness its posthumous survival throughout the Middle Ages. Later still, we see vain attempts made to restore it to life, first by Charles V. and then by Napoleon Buonaparte.

"The Germanic Invasions The Making of Europe, AD 400-600",Lucien Musset,Penn State University Press,1975,"The Barbarian invasions that brought about the fall of the Roman Empire in the West laid the foundations of Europe as we know it.

The written documents are few, and often ambiguous; and he must fall back on the still more vague evidence provided by archaeology, epigraphy, numismatics, linguistics, and toponymy. This book, by one of the foremost experts on the Dark Ages, provides authoritative guidelines to the bewildering flux of the period and recharts the fundamentals of such knowledge as the historian can obtain. The original French edition of Professor Musset's work--published under the title Les Invasions: les vagues germaniques--was hailed by scholars everywhere as a work that brilliantly summarized modern scholarship on the invasions and their consequences. In Part One Professor Musset establishes the framework of his study, tracing the history of each wave of invasions. In Part Two he outlines the frontiers of knowledge in areas of major importance where no consensus has been reached, and indicates lines of desirable future research. Part Three provides a thorough and up-to-date bibliography, arranged according to topic and area. This book makes an outstanding contribution to a field of study in which interest is growing.

In this comprehensive and engaging book, we delve into the lives of the soldiers, traders, and settlers who dared to venture beyond the empire's secure borders. From the windswept plains of North Africa to the dense forests of Germania, Rome's frontiers were a crucible of conflict and cooperation. The Roman army, a formidable force of discipline and strength, stood guard against barbarian incursions and maintained order within the provinces. Yet, beyond the military camps, a vibrant world of trade and cultural exchange flourished. The frontiers were not merely lines on a map; they were spaces where different cultures collided and mingled, shaping the course of history. From the bustling marketplaces of the East to the remote outposts of Britain, Rome's frontiers were a melting pot of languages, religions, and traditions. We will explore the challenges and triumphs that shaped this ancient civilization. We will uncover the complex relationships between Rome and its neighbors, from the fierce Berber tribes of North Africa to the nomadic Parthians of the East. Through this journey, we will gain a deeper understanding of the Roman Empire and its enduring legacy. This book is an essential read for anyone interested in ancient history, military strategy, or the dynamics of cultural exchange.

Borders and Freedom of Movement in the Holy Roman Empire,Luca Scholz,Oxford University Press,2020-01-16,"In the Holy Roman Empire 'no prince... can forbid men passage in the common road', wrote the English jurist John Selden. In practice, moving through one the most fractured landscapes in human history was rarely as straightforward as suggested by Selden's account of the German 'liberty of passage'. Across the Old Reich, mobile populations-from emperors to peasants-defied attempts to channel their mobility with actions ranging from mockery to bloodshed. In this study, Luca Scholz charts this contentious ordering of movement through the lens of safe conduct, an institution that was common throughout the early modern world but became a key framework for negotiating freedom of movement and its restriction in the Empire. Borders and Freedom of Movement in the Holy Roman Empire draws on sources discovered in twenty archives, from newly unearthed drawings to first-hand accounts by peasants, princes, and prisoners. Scholz's maps shift the focus from the border to the thoroughfare to show that controls of moving goods and people were rarely concentrated at borders before the mid-eighteenth century. Uncovering a forgotten chapter in the history of free movement, the author presents a new look at the unstable relationship of political authority and human mobility in the heartlands of old-regime Europe.",279,History,en,9780192584441,rome imperial borders
Frontiers of the Roman Empire,Hugh Elton,Routledge,2013-04-15,"With its succinct analysis of the overriding issues and detailed case-studies based on the latest archaeological research, this social and economic study of Roman Imperial frontiers is essential reading. Too often the frontier has been represented as a simple linear boundary. The reality, argues Dr Elton, was rather a fuzzy set of interlocking zones - political, military, judicial and financial. After discussion of frontier theory and types of frontier, the author analyses the acquisition of an empire and the ways in which it was ruled. He addresses the vexed question of how to define the edges of provinces, and covers the relationship with allied kingdoms. Regional variation and different rates of change are seen as significant - as is illustrated by Civilis' revolt on the Rhine in AD 69. He uses another case-study - Dura-Europos - to exemplify the role of the army on the frontier, especially its relations with the population on both sides of the border. The central importance of trade is highlighted by special consideration of Palmyra.",149,History,en,9781134724574,rome imperial borders

Orthodoxy and the Courts in Late Antiquity,Caroline Humfress,OUP Oxford,2007-11-01,"This book approaches the subject of late Roman law from the perspective of legal practice revealed in courtroom processes, as well as more 'informal' types of dispute settlement. From at least the early fourth century, leading bishops, ecclesiastics, and Christian polemicists participated in a vibrant culture of forensic argument, with far-reaching effects on theological debate, the development of ecclesiastical authority, and the elaboration of early 'Canon law'. One of the most innovative aspects of late Roman law was the creation and application of new legal categories used in the prosecution of 'heretics'. Leading Christian polemicists not only used techniques of argument learnt in the late Roman rhetorical schools to help position the Church within the structure of Empire, they also used those techniques in cases involving accusations against 'heretics'- thus defining and developing the concept of Christian orthodoxy itself.",359,History,en,9780191518768,late antiquity
The Historians of Late Antiquity,David Rohrbacher,Routledge,2013-04-15,"The fourth and fifth centuries AD were an era of religious conflict, political change and military conflict. The responses of contemporary historians to these turbulent times reflect their diverse backgrounds - Christian and pagan, writing in both Greek and Latin, documenting church and state. This volume is the first to offer an accessible survey of the lives and works of these varied figures. The first half of the book explores the structure, style, purpose and nature of their writings. The second half compares and contrasts the information the historians provide, and the views they express on some central topics. These range from historiography, government and religion to barbarian invasions, and the controversial emperors Julian 'The Apostate' and Theodosius.",329,Biography & Autobiography,en,9781134628841,late antiquity
Cyprus in the Long Late Antiquity History and Archaeology Between the Sixth and the Eighth Centuries,"Panayiotis Panayides, Ine Jacobs",Oxbow Books,2023-01-24,"Cyprus was a thriving and densely populated late antique province. Contrary to what used to be thought, the Arab raids of the mid-seventh century did not abruptly bring the island’s prosperity to an end. Recent research instead highlights long-lasting continuity in both urban and rural contexts. This volume brings together historians and archaeologists working on diverse aspects of Cyprus between the sixth and eighth centuries. They discuss topics as varied as rural prosperity, urban endurance, artisanal production, civic and private religion and maritime connectivity. The role of the imperial administration and of the Church is touched upon in several contributions. Other articles place Cyprus back into its wider Mediterranean context.

The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity AD 395-700,Averil Cameron,Routledge,2015-04-29,"This thoroughly revised and expanded edition of The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity, now covering the period 395-700 AD, provides both a detailed introduction to late antiquity and a direct challenge to conventional views of the end of the Roman empire. Leading scholar Averil Cameron focuses on the changes and continuities in Mediterranean society as a whole before the Arab conquests. Two new chapters survey the situation in the east after the death of Justinian and cover the Byzantine wars with Persia, religious developments in the eastern Mediterranean during the life of Muhammad, the reign of Heraclius, the Arab conquests and the establishment of the Umayyad caliphate. Using the latest in-depth archaeological evidence, this all-round historical and thematic study of the west and the eastern empire has become the standard work on the period. The new edition takes account of recent research on topics such as the barbarian ‘invasions’, periodization, and questions of decline or continuity, as well as the current interest in church councils, orthodoxy and heresy and the separation of the miaphysite church in the sixth-century east. It contains a new introductory survey of recent scholarship on the fourth century AD, and has a full bibliography and extensive notes with suggestions for further reading. The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity 395-700 AD continues to be the benchmark for publications on the history of Late Antiquity and is indispensible to anyone studying the period.",401,History,en,9781136673054,late antiquity

New Perspectives on Late Antiquity,David Hernández de la Fuente,Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2011-01-18,"Perhaps it is fully justified to think of Late Antiquity (3rd–7th centuries) as the first Renaissance of the Classical World. This period can be considered a fundamental landmark for the transmission of the Classical Legacy and the transition between the ancient and the medieval individual. During Late Antiquity the Classical Education or enkyklios paideia of Hellenism was linked definitively to the Judeo-Christian and Germanic elements that have modelled the Western World. The present volume combines diverse interests and methodologies with a single purpose—unity and diversity, as a Neo-Platonic motto—providing an overall picture of the new means of researching Late Antiquity. This collective endeavour, stemming from the 2009 1st International Congress on Late Antiquity in Segovia (Spain), focuses not only on the analysis of new materials and latest findings, but rather puts together different perspectives offering a scientific update and a dialogue between several disciplines. New Perspectives on Late Antiquity contains two main sections—1. Ancient History and Archaeology, and 2. Philosophy and Classical Studies—including both overview papers and case studies. Among the contributors to this volume are some of the most relevant scholars in their fields, including P. Brown, J. Alvar, P. Barceló, C. Codoñer, F. Fronterotta, D. Gigli, F. Lisi and R.

Late Ancient Knowing Explorations in Intellectual History,"Catherine Michael Chin, Moulie Vidas",Univ of California Press,2015-05-02,"In this collection of essays, scholars from a range of disciplines explore the activity of knowing in late antiquity by focusing on thirteen major concepts from the intellectual, social, political, and cultural history of the period. They ask two questions about each of these concepts: what did late ancient people know about them, and how was that knowledge expressed in people’s actions? Late Ancient Knowing integrates intellectual history, post-structuralist literary theory, and recent trends in cognitive science to examine the ways that historical thought-worlds both shaped individual lives and were in turn shaped by the actions of individuals. Each chapter treats its main concept as a problem both of knowledge and of practice or behavior. The result is a richly imagined description of how people of this time understood and navigated their world, from travel through the countryside and encounters with demons to philosophical medicine and the etiquette of imperial courts.",313,History,en,9780520960923,late antiquity

The ^AFall of the Roman Empire A New History of Rome and the Barbarians,Peter Heather,Oxford University Press,2005-12-01,"A leading authority on the late Roman Empire, Peter Heather reveals how how Europe's barbarians, transformed by centuries of contact with Rome on every possible level, eventually pulled the empire apart. He shows first how the Huns overturned the existing strategic balance of power on Rome's European frontiers, to force the Goths and others to seek refuge inside the Empire. This prompted two generations of struggle, during which new barbarian coalitions, formed in response to Roman hostility, brought the Roman west to its knees. Heather convincingly argues that the Roman Empire was not on the brink of social or moral collapse. What brought it to an end were the barbarians.",605,History,en,9780199741182,fall of the western roman empire
"The Fall of the Western Roman Empire Archaeology, History and the Decline of Rome",Neil Christie,Bloomsbury Academic,2012-02-15,"The decline of the Roman Empire has been a subject of fascination and debate for centuries. In this original new work, Neil Christie draws on numerous sources, interweaving the latest archaeological evidence, to reconstruct the period's landscape and events. In the process, he rethinks some of historians' most widely held and long-established views: Was the Empire's disintegration caused primarily by external or internal factors? Why did the Eternal City of Old Rome collapse in the West, while the 'New Rome' of Constantinople endured in the East? What was destroyed and what remained of Roman culture after successive invasions by Vandals, Goths, Huns and other 'barbarians', and what was the impact of the new Christian religion? As Christie expertly demonstrates, the archaeology of the late Roman period reveals intriguing answers to these and other questions. Taking an innovative, interdisciplinary approach that combines traditional historical methods and a unique familiarity with the Empire's physical remnants, he uncovers new aspects of Rome's military struggles, its shifting geography, and the everyday lives of its subjects. Written in a clear, accessible style, The Fall of the Western Roman Empire is a perfect introduction for newcomers to the subject, and essential reading for undergraduate students and specialists in archaeology and ancient history.",0,History,en,1849663378,fall of the western roman empire

Theoderic and the Roman Imperial Restoration,Jonathan J. Arnold,Cambridge University Press,2014-02-24,"This book provides a new interpretation of the fall of the Roman Empire and the 'barbarian' kingdom known conventionally as Ostrogothic Italy. Relying primarily on Italian textual and material evidence, and in particular the works of Cassiodorus and Ennodius, Jonathan J. Arnold argues that contemporary Italo-Romans viewed the Ostrogothic kingdom as the Western Roman Empire and its 'barbarian' king, Theoderic (r.489/93–526), as its emperor. Investigating conceptions of Romanness, Arnold explains how the Roman past, both immediate and distant, allowed Theoderic and his Goths to find acceptance in Italy as Romans, with roles essential to the Empire's perceived recovery. Theoderic and the Roman Imperial Restoration demonstrates how Theoderic's careful attention to imperial traditions, good governance, and reconquest followed by the re-Romanization of lost imperial territories contributed to contemporary sentiments of imperial resurgence and a golden age. There was no need for Justinian to restore the Western Empire: Theoderic had already done so.",353,History,en,9781107729872,imperial restoration

More than just a fighting force, this army was the setting in which hundreds of thousands of men forged relationships and manoeuvred for promotion. The officers of this force, from famous generals like Belisarius and Narses to lesser-known men like Buzes and Artabanes, not only fought battles but also crafted social networks and cultivated their relationships with their emperor, fellow officers, families, and subordinate soldiers. Looming in the background were differences in identity, particularly between Romans and those they identified as barbarians. Drawing on numerical evidence and stories from sixth-century authors who understood the military, Justinian’s Men highlights a sixth-century Byzantine army that was vibrant, lively, and full of individuals working with and against each other.",229,History,en,9781137562043,justinian

Justinian's Plague and the Caliphate Pandemics - history of wars,I.

I forgot fear. I felt God /// and light embraced me. /// And time stopped for long… /// I came back to myself ... /// The book presents the history of the evolution of mankind over a certain period of time, covering the decline of antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. It discusses the events taking place in the Mediterranean, southern Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia from the 6th to the 11th century, during the period of plague pandemics. It is shown that it was the plague that became the root cause of the sharp weakening of Byzantium and the Sassanian state, led to the devastation of a significant part of their territories and the complete restructuring of society, affected the demography, economy and even the political system. The book analyzes the reasons for the rise of the Arabs and the success of their campaigns of conquest, proves that the Caliphate as a state could not have emerged and occupied vast territories of its powerful neighbors if they had not been weakened and bled by the plague. The connection of pandemics with the rise and strengthening of the role of the Catholic Church in the West and Islam in the East is considered. It is shown how, with the arrival of the plague in the Caliphate, its gradual decline begins. This allows the author to deviate from the established opinion that the plague played only a secondary role in the fall of Byzantium and the Sassanid states, to conclude that it was the plague that was the real “director” of all events in the period under consideration, and that the Caliphate is the only state that was born ""thanks"" to the plague and was destroyed by it. The book shows how the search for countering the plague became for the Caliphate in the period from the 8th to the 11th century an impetus to accelerated evolution, comparable to the revolutionary one. This allows the author to deviate from the established opinion that the plague played only a secondary role in the fall of Byzantium and the Sassanid states, to conclude that it was the plague that was the real “director” of all events in the period under consideration, and that the Caliphate is the only state that was born ""thanks"" to the plague and was destroyed by it.

The book shows how the search for countering the plague became for the Caliphate in the period from the 8th to the 11th century an impetus to accelerated evolution, comparable to the revolutionary one. /// A PANDEMIC is a history of wars against humanity, a struggle where, at the end of the day, human evolution, after initial failures, eventually won out. /// For one and a half thousand years, mankind has not stopped talking, debating and writing about the plague. This is understandable. The plague destroyed empires and forced to change the economic structure of civilizations, under its influence, whether new religions arose and new ethnic groups were formed. /// The book offered to the reader's attention is an attempt to penetrate into the essence of the plague problem, an attempt to comprehend its nature, to dispel the mysteries that envelop it. But my main goal is to raise an issue that goes beyond conventional wisdom. No serious historian denies that the plague has played a role in the history of civilizations. But for them the problem of the epidemic remained in the background for a long time, since all attention was focused on the analysis of the development of states, societies, economies and civilizations. At the same time, epidemics were viewed as some kind of external forces, although capable of causing disorder in the social order, but having nothing to do with the course of world history. The author of these lines is convinced that this is a clear underestimation of pandemics, which occupy the first place in importance in the changes taking place with humanity. /// My book is the history of the evolution of mankind at a certain period of time, the time of the decline of antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. It has seven main parts. The first is directly based on Greek, Syrian and Muslim sources about the plague. I will have to consider in detail the events in the time frame from the 6th to the 8th centuries, including the rise and fall of Byzantium, the impact of the epidemic, which led to serious devastation in its territories and a complete restructuring of society, as well as the process of the formation of a completely new civilization, which is now commonly called the civilization of the West. In the same period, from the 6th to the 8th century, the rise and spread of the conquest campaigns of the Muslims, the rise and fall of the Umayyad Caliphate (in the 5th part) took place. From the 6th to the 8th century, we see the flourishing of the scientific upsurge of the Muslim Renaissance under the rule of the Abbasids. It must be said that it is the history of the Caliphate that can serve as a brilliant confirmation of the omnipotence of the plague. This empire, most likely, would not have arisen if Byzantium and the Sassanian state were not covered by pandemics. The Caliphate was born ""thanks to"" the plague, but it also destroyed him. /// In my book, I propose to look at history precisely through such a prism, using facts about epidemics and assigning them a key role in the historical events that happened to our ancestors. The interaction of disease with a species as a kind of test for survival in the face of mass mortality, the consequences of epidemic-induced genetic selection, manifested in the demographic processes of countries that have survived pandemics - this is what catches the eye in an unbiased analysis.",319,History,en,,justinian

Roman Emperor Zeno The Perils of Power Politics in Fifth-century Constantinople,Peter Crawford,Pen and Sword History,2019-02-28,"Peter Crawford examines the life and career of the fifth-century Roman emperor Zeno and the various problems he faced before and during his seventeen-year rule. Despite its length, his reign has hitherto been somewhat overlooked as being just a part of that gap between the Theodosian and Justinianic dynasties of the Eastern Roman Empire which is comparatively poorly furnished with historical sources. Reputedly brought in as a counter-balance to the generals who had dominated Constantinopolitan politics at the end of the Theodosian dynasty, the Isaurian Zeno quickly had to prove himself adept at dealing with the harsh realities of imperial power. Zeno's life and reign is littered with conflict and politicking with various groups - the enmity of both sides of his family; dealing with the fallout of the collapse of the Empire of Attila in Europe, especially the increasingly independent tribal groups established on the frontiers of, and even within, imperial territory; the end of the Western Empire; and the continuing religious strife within the Roman world. As a result, his reign was an eventful and significant one that deserves this long-overdue spotlight.",390,History,en,9781473859272,odoacer
Christianization and Commonwealth in Early Medieval Europe A Ritual Interpretation,Nathan J. Ristuccia,Oxford University Press,2018-02-09,"Christianization and Commonwealth in Early Medieval Europe re-examines the alterations in Western European life that followed widespread conversion to Christianity-the phenomena traditionally termed ""Christianization"". It refocuses scholarly paradigms for Christianization around the development of mandatory rituals. One prominent ritual, Rogationtide supplies an ideal case study demonstrating a new paradigm of ""Christianization without religion."" Christianization in the Middle Ages was not a slow process through which a Christian system of religious beliefs and practices replaced an earlier pagan system. In the Middle Ages, religion did not exist in the sense of a fixed system of belief bounded off from other spheres of life. Rather, Christianization was primarily ritual performance. Being a Christian meant joining a local church community. After the fall of Rome, mandatory rituals such as Rogationtide arose to separate a Christian commonwealth from the pagans, heretics, and Jews outside it. A Latin West between the polis and the parish had its own institution-the Rogation procession-for organizing local communities. For medieval people, sectarian borders were often flexible and rituals served to demarcate these borders. Rogationtide is an ideal case study of this demarcation, because it was an emotionally powerful feast, which combined pageantry with doctrinal instruction, community formation, social ranking, devotional exercises, and bodily mortification. As a result, rival groups quarrelled over the holiday's meaning and procedure, sometimes violently, in order to reshape the local order and ban people and practices as non-Christian.",273,Religion,en,9780192539649,christianization

Leading scholars explore the role of the spread of Christianity and the formation of new principalities in the birth of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland and Rus' around the year 1000. Drawing on history, archaeology and art history, and emphasizing problems related to the sources and historiographical debates, they demonstrate the complex interdependence between the processes of religious and political change, covering conditions prior to the introduction of Christianity, the adoption of Christianity, and the development of the rulers' power. Regional patterns emerge, highlighting both the similarities in ruler-sponsored cases of Christianization, and differences in the consolidation of power and in institutions introduced by Christianity. The essays reveal how local societies adopted Christianity; medieval ideas of what constituted the dividing line between Christians and non-Christians; and the connections between Christianity and power.",417,History,en,9781139468367,christianization
Christianizing Egypt Syncretism and Local Worlds in Late Antiquity,David Frankfurter,Princeton University Press,2017-12-05,"How does a culture become Christian, especially one that is heir to such ancient traditions and spectacular monuments as Egypt? This book offers a new model for envisioning the process of Christianization by looking at the construction of Christianity in the various social and creative worlds active in Egyptian culture during late antiquity. As David Frankfurter shows, members of these different social and creative worlds came to create different forms of Christianity according to their specific interests, their traditional idioms, and their sense of what the religion could offer. Reintroducing the term “syncretism” for the inevitable and continuous process by which a religion is acculturated, the book addresses the various formations of Egyptian Christianity that developed in the domestic sphere, the worlds of holy men and saints’ shrines, the work of craftsmen and artisans, the culture of monastic scribes, and the reimagination of the landscape itself, through processions, architecture, and the potent remains of the past. Drawing on sermons and magical texts, saints’ lives and figurines, letters and amulets, and comparisons with Christianization elsewhere in the Roman empire and beyond, Christianizing Egypt reconceives religious change—from the “conversion” of hearts and minds to the selective incorporation and application of strategies for protection, authority, and efficacy, and for imagining the environment.",336,Religion,en,9780691176970,christianization

Christianization and Commonwealth in Early Medieval Europe A Ritual Interpretation,Nathan J. Ristuccia,Oxford University Press,2018,"Christianization and Commonwealth in Early Medieval Europe re-examines the alterations in Western European life that followed widespread conversion to Christianity-the phenomena traditionally termed ""Christianization"". It refocuses scholarly paradigms for Christianization around the development of mandatory rituals. One prominent ritual, Rogationtide supplies an ideal case study demonstrating a new paradigm of ""Christianization without religion."" Christianization in the Middle Ages was not a slow process through which a Christian system of religious beliefs and practices replaced an earlier pagan system. In the Middle Ages, religion did not exist in the sense of a fixed system of belief bounded off from other spheres of life. Rather, Christianization was primarily ritual performance. Being a Christian meant joining a local church community. After the fall of Rome, mandatory rituals such as Rogationtide arose to separate a Christian commonwealth from the pagans, heretics, and Jews outside it. A Latin West between the polis and the parish had its own institution-the Rogation procession-for organizing local communities. For medieval people, sectarian borders were often flexible and rituals served to demarcate these borders. Rogationtide is an ideal case study of this demarcation, because it was an emotionally powerful feast, which combined pageantry with doctrinal instruction, community formation, social ranking, devotional exercises, and bodily mortification. As a result, rival groups quarrelled over the holiday's meaning and procedure, sometimes violently, in order to reshape the local order and ban people and practices as non-Christian.",273,History,en,9780198810209,christianization

African-American Religion A Confluent of African Traditional Religion and Christianity,David Musa,AuthorHouse,2015-07-06,"Literature on North American slavery is almost inexhaustible but negligent of the religious culture of the slaves, most especially African-American Christianity. As noted in Robert Handys insightful article, for several decades AfricanAmerican Christianity appeared only as incidentals in the general historiography of American Church history. Considering the immeasurably positive role of the Church in the lives of African-Americans, this oversight is almost inexcusable. Even where studies in slave Christianity have been attempted one would search in vain for any substantial discussion of the mutual effects of the slaves original African religion and Christianity. Thus this study is a contribution to recent explorations into that vital aspect of the history of African slaves in North America their Christianization. The study focuses on the question of why the African slaves were apparently more responsive to Christianity in the Great Awakenings than during the previous evangelization efforts by the Anglican missionaries. I propose that the continuities as well as discontinuities between Christianity and African Traditional Religion were key among determinant factors in the slaves response to Christianity. Basically, the slaves responded to the type of Christianity in which these factors were more prominent, the Great Awakenings vis--vis the Anglican version. The first chapter of this study highlights the problem of past inattention to slave Christianity, especially as it relates to African Traditional Religion. In Chapter two, I argue for both West Africa as the original home of the slaves and African Traditional Religion as the predominant religious culture of that region. The third chapter describes the process, personnel, and problems encountered in slave Christianization. Chapters four and five analyze and evaluate the impact of Christianizing efforts by the Anglican missionaries and revival evangelists respectively. Chapter six summarizes and discusses the value of my findings for the African-American Church and Christianity in general. The study contains suggestions for further research.",254,Education,en,9781504913683,christianization

D. 802-867) Tm: history of Byzantine civilization, in which social elements of the West and the East are so curiously blended and fused into a unique culture, will not be written for many years to come. It cannot be written until each successive epoch has been exhaustively studied and its distinguishing characteristics clearly ascertained. The fallacious assumption, once accepted as a truism, that the Byzantine spirit knew no change or shadow of turning, that the social atmosphere of the Eastern Rome was always immutably the same, has indeed been dis credited; but even in recent sketches of this civilization by competent hands we can see unconscious survivals of that belief. The curve of the whole development has still to be accurately traced, and this can only be done by defining each section by means of the evidence which applies to that section alone.

History of the Byzantine Empire Rise and Fall of the Eastern Roman Empire from Constantine the Great to Fall of Constantinople,Interesting History,,2019-04-07,"The history of the Byzantium Empire is based on Byzantine and non-Byzantine sources. The starting point is given by Byzantine historians and chroniclers who with more or less accuracy write about historical events.Roman state organization, Greek culture, and Christianity are the foundations of the Byzantine Empire. This merger was due to the displacement of the Roman Empire to the East, caused by the great crisis of the third century. At first, the history of Byzantium was considered only the continuation of the Roman Empire. The name ""Byzantium"" originates from a later period. Its inhabitants called themselves the Romans, and their rulers were regarded as Roman emperors. Considering itself for the only legal empire of the world, Byzantium wanted the reign of all the countries of the former Roman Empire. Later, everything was reduced to ideological supremacy. By the time, Byzantium faded away from its original Roman foundations - the Empire was Hellenized and theocratized, and economic, social and political development led to the formation of a new economic and social order and a new state order. Thus, at the end of Byzantine history, the only connection with the Roman Empire was the name and some surviving traditions.The first three centuries of the Byzantine, or the last three centuries of the Roman Empire, are a period called the early-Byzantine, or later Late Roman times. The western part of the empire has experienced an economic collapse. The east was also endangered, but it survived. Characteristic is the steady increase in latifundia, at the expense of tiny possession and imperial domain. The peasant masses are increasingly bound to the fetus. In turbulent times, the principle was replaced by Diocletian's dominant, which is the root of Byzantine autocracy. The old municipal organization of Roman cities was in decline. The state administration was in the hands of the emperor and the craftsman. Car dignity was no longer a supreme magistracy but a despotic authority based on God's will. In the Early Byzantine period imperialism of the emperor was limited by the Senate, the army and the urban population organized in demos. their significance decreases over time, and the influence of the church grows more and more. The conflicts of the world with the dominant world in Byzantine history were roads, but these two components were inspired by the same ideals and related to common interests. Thus, the emperor was not only the supreme commander of the army, the supreme judge and legislator, but also the defense attorney of the church and true religion. All the inhabitants of the empire were emperor's servants. They greeted him prokinese, falling in front of him. Although Christian, Byzantium preserved the cultural treasures of antiquity without distraction from pagan art and wisdom - Roman law, Greek philosophy, poetry and historiography. The power of Byzantium was primarily based on money, rather than on war. The riches of this were merciless fiscalism. The wealth and high culture of the state are paid by misery, injustice and the loss of freedom of the population.",76,,en,1093161396,eastern roman empire

"Aspar and the Struggle for the Eastern Roman Empire, AD 421–71",Ronald A. Bleeker,Bloomsbury Publishing,2022-04-07,"The first full-length biography in English of Aspar, the eastern Roman general and statesman, this book explores his central role in the history and politics of the fragmenting Roman Empire in the fifth century. It also considers what his life and career may suggest as to the differing fates of the eastern and western parts of the empire. Taking a chronological approach, Bleeker guides us through what is known of Aspar's life and his changing influence in the eastern Roman army and court. Born and raised in Constantinople, Aspar primarily viewed and presented himself as a Roman general, consul, and senator. Yet he also stood outside the Roman mainstream in two important ways–as a member of the empire's “barbarian” military leadership and as a devout Arian Christian. Early chapters treat his formative military experiences with the Persians, a Roman usurper in Italy, the Vandals in Africa, and the Huns of Attila, while later chapters focus on Aspar's political role in resolving the two imperial succession crises that struck the eastern Roman empire in the mid-fifth century and his extended struggle to control the succession to Leo I. Bleeker builds on earlier studies in three ways. First, previous work has largely concentrated on the role of “barbarian” generals in the western Roman empire, while much less attention has been paid to similar figures (such as Aspar) in the east. Secondly, while important recent work has explored the prevalence of “child-emperors” in the late-fourth and early-fifth centuries, this book suggests a further evolution of the imperial role in the mid-fifth century. Finally, while previous studies of this period have focused on Aspar's late career role in the succession struggles, a full study allows us to see how and why his relations with other key figures within and outside the eastern Roman government changed over the course of his lengthy career.",249,History,en,9781350279285,eastern roman empire

Domesticating Saints in Medieval and Early Modern Rome,Maya Maskarinec,University of Pennsylvania Press,2025-03-04,"How elite Roman families used genealogy, architecture, and the urban fabric to appropriate the city’s saints for their own Domesticating Saints in Medieval and Early Modern Rome explores the creative efforts of some of Rome’s most prominent noble families to weave themselves into Rome’s Christian past. Maya Maskarinec shows how, from late antiquity to early modernity, elite Roman families used genealogy, architecture, and the urban fabric to appropriate the city’s saints for their own, eventually claiming them as ancestors. Over the course of the Middle Ages, there developed a pronounced sense that churches and their saints belonged to specific regions, neighborhoods, and even families. These associations, coupled with a resurgent interest in Rome’s Christian antiquity as well as in noble lineages, enabled Roman families to “domesticate” the city’s saints and dominate the urban landscape and its politics into the early modern era. These families cultivated saintly genealogies and saintly topologies (exploiting, for example, the increasingly prolific identification of churches as the former residences of early Christian and late antique saints), cementing presumed connections between place, descent, and moral worth. Drawing from sources spanning the fourth to the late sixteenth century, Maskarinec brings into conversation saints’ lives, documentary evidence, family genealogies, monumental and domestic architecture, and medieval and early modern guidebooks, sources not often studied together. Bridging the divide between secular and sacred histories of Rome, Domesticating Saints in Medieval and Early Modern Rome repositions these materials within a new story, of how Romans made the city’s classical and Christian past their own and thereby empowered and immortalized their families.",337,History,en,9781512827026,medieval rome

The Archaeology of Volga Bulgaria in the 10th to Early 13th Centuries,Konstantin A.

For several centuries, it operated as a bridge between the Christian West and the Muslim East. As such, it is widely believed that the colossal transit of oriental silver coin through the state was the foundation of the Bulgar economy while Islam consolidated statehood in the Middle Volga region. Drawing on the rich archaeological record, Konstantin Rudenko argues against this view, demonstrating that the Bulgar culture was instead formed on the basis of its own resources. The Bulgars thus represent a unique example of relatively rapid change from nomadism to sedentism and urbanization, with no significant influence from neighboring, developed states. Cultural syncretism therefore emerged as a key characteristic of Volga Bulgaria.",371,Social Science,en,9789004679368,early bulgars

After the royal family converted to Judaism in the ninth century, many nobles and common people did likewise. The Khazars were ruled by a succession of Jewish kings and adopted many hallmarks of Jewish civilization, including study of the Torah and Talmud, Hebrew script, and the observance of Jewish holidays. The third edition of The Jews of Khazaria tells the compelling true story of this kingdom past.",375,Religion,en,9781538103432,early bulgars
The Roman Empire Divided 400-700 AD,John Moorhead,Routledge,2013-11-26,"In 400 the mighty Roman Empire was almost as large as it had ever been; within three centuries, advances by Germanic peoples in western Europe, Slavs in eastern Europe and Arabs around the eastern and southern shores of the Mediterranean had brought about the loss of most of its territory. Ranging from Britain to Mesopotamia, this book explores the changes that resulted from these movements. It shows the different paths away from the classical past that were taken, and how the relatively unified civilization of the ancient Mediterranean gave place to the very different civilizations that cluster around the sea today. This comprehensive and authoritative second edition has been thoroughly revised and updated line-by-line, and contains several new sections dealing for instance with the new evidence provided by recent finds like the Staffordshire Treasure and the widespread effects of the plague. As well as a completely new bibliographical essay, The Roman Empire Divided now also includes six maps and an expanded selection of illustrations fully integrated in the text.",377,History,en,9781317861447,early bulgars

The Politics of Identity in Visigothic Spain Religion and Power in the Histories of Isidore of Seville,Jamie Wood,BRILL,2012-03-20,"Previous scholarship has interpreted Bishop Isidore of Seville (d. 636) retrospectively as the architect of the medieval Spanish church, as the father of Spanish identity, and as a key figure in the transmission of Classical and Patristic learning to the Middle Ages. Drawing on recent studies on identity formation in the early medieval period and an upsurge in interest in late antique Spain, this book examines the historical Isidore as a social actor managing a complex web of responsibilities and relationships. A comparative analysis of Isidore's historical works demonstrates that writing about the past was a method for reconciling Visigothic kings, nobles and Spanish bishops in a period of transformation. This results in a fresh portrait of Isidore as motivated, both politically and pastorally, to balance competing interests and ensure the spiritual and material security of the people of Spain.",287,History,en,9789004224322,visigothic spain

Visigothic Spain La EspaÑa Visigoda,Harry E. Babbitt,,2018-03-19,"Volume 4 of our bilingual series of eBooks (VISIGOTHIC SPAIN -- LA ESPAÑA VISIGODA) covers the history of the Visigoths in Spain from the middle of the 5th century to the year 711. Shortly before and especially after the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD, the Visigoths crossed the Pyrenees and immigrated in several waves into northern Spain. Most of the Visigothic tribes had helped the Romans defend their northern borders and so were familiar with the Roman way of life. In 589 King Recaredo renounced Arianism and adopted Catholicism as the official religion of the Visigoths. One of the most famous religious figures of the time was St. Isidore (San Isidoro) who is said to have been one of the wisest men of that period. Perhaps the greatest legacies left to Spain by the Visigoths are several historic churches that date from the 7th century. Among them are Quintanilla de las Viñas, San Pedro de la Nave, San Juan de los Baños and Santa Comba de Bande. At the beginning of the 8th century several Visigothic families were feuding for control of the empire. The Moors of northern Africa saw this weakness as an opportunity for an attack in the south of Spain. In 711, a general named Tarik crossed the strait and landed at Gibraltar, a named which means ""Rock of Tarik."" Soon thereafter the Moors defeated the Visigothic army at the Battle of Guadalete and then were able to occupy most of the Iberian Peninsula. They would rule a great part of Spain for almost 800 years until their last stronghold of Granada fell to the Christians in 1492.This book is the fouth in a series of bilingual guides (English & Spanish) for teachers and students -- each featuring an important topic in the field of history, literature or art of Spain and Latin America.

The Visigothic Kingdom The Negotiation of Power in Post-Roman lberia,"Panzram, Paulo Pachá",Taylor & Francis,2025-10-01,"How did the breakdown of Roman rule in the Iberian Peninsula eventually result in the formation of a Visigothic kingdom with authority centralised in Toledo? This collection of essays challenges the view that local powers were straightforwardly subjugated to the expanding central power of the monarchy. Rather than interpret countervailing events as mere ‘delays’ in this inevitable process, the contributors to this book interrogate where these events came from, which causes can be uncovered and how much influence individual actors had in this process. What emerges is a story of contested interests seeking cooperation through institutions and social practices that were flexible enough to stabilise a system that was hierarchical yet mutually beneficial for multiple social groups. By examining the Visigothic settlement, the interplay between central and local power, the use of ethnic identity, projections of authority, and the role of the Church, this book articulates a model for understanding the formation of a large and important early medieval kingdom.",410,History,en,9781040783528,visigothic spain

The Siege at Port Arthur,Ron Blum,,1987,"""The twin photographs shown in this book are reproductions of old stereographs more commonly known as stereo views. They were taken by a special camera having two horizontally mounted lenses spaced about seven centimeters apart, which is about the same spacing as between our eyes. When the stereograph is correctly viewed through an optical viewer such that the left eye sees the picture taken by the camera's left lens and the right eye sees the picture taken by the camera's right lens, each eye will perceive a slightly different perspective. On receiving the two different images, the brain will fuse the scene into one three dimensional picture, often referred to as 3D. Depth is the third dimension, which when combined with height and breadth, seemingly brings the picture to life ... In this book, the enlarged single image located above each stereoscopic pair enables quick viewing of the scene without using the viewing device ... Most of the scenes reproduced in this book were taken by James Ricalton who, at the time, was employed by stereograph publishing firm of Underwood and Underwood. We are fortunate today to be able to view his stereographs and to experience the realism of his three dimensional images.

Blood of Avalon,Adrian Gilbert,Allen & Unwin,2014-02-01,"In this controversial new book, Adrian Gilbert reveals the real reason why Charles married Diana and how, through her, the Royal Family was reconnected with the line of King Arthur, the guardians of the Holy Grail. It's a story which goes back to Mary, the mother of Jesus, and Joseph of Arimathea, to the real King Arthur, ruler of Glamorgan and Pendragon of all Britain. Reinterpreting ancient sources in the light of recent discoveries, Gilbert takes the reader on a journey to Britain's mystical past: from Arthur to the fairy-tale wedding of Charles and Diana to the birth of Prince William on the summer solstice of 1982. He identifies the real Avalon, the location of the fabled Grail castle and the burial place of King Arthur. He also explains the significance of the Wars of the Roses, the wider role of Queen Elizabeth I, tracing other descendants of King Arthur and the early grail dynasty to the present time. He is able to show how not just Diana, the Princess of Wales, but also Sir Winston Churchill, were descended from the Holy Grail family of the Virgin Mary, revealing one of the greatest secrets of our time.",258,"Body, Mind & Spirit",en,9781742698519,arthur

The Administration of the Norman kingdom of Sicily,Takayama,BRILL,2021-09-20,"The administration of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily has long been held up to be the most advanced government in twelfth-century Europe. However, until now there has been considerable confusion about how this bureaucracy actually functioned, whether it developed in the 12th century or retained the form given it by Roger II; whether it had regional variations, what the identity of different departments of government was, who did what within the structures of government, and what the relationship between the Greek, Arabic and Latin elements within the administration was. This work goes a long way to sorting out these problems. The author's meticulous work with chronicles and charters enable him to clear up many problems and mysteries in the administration of finance and justice and to identify such uncertainties as remain. This fundamental work forms a basic reference point for future studies of Norman Sicily and of government in the high Middle Ages.",307,History,en,9789004476240,norman kingdom
The Norman Kingdom of Sicily,Donald Matthew,Cambridge University Press,1992-07-30,"This book is an introductory account of the kingdom of Sicily established in 1130 by Roger II, a 'Norman' king, and ruled by Roger, his own son and grandsons until 1194 when the kingdom was conquered by his son-in-law, Henry VI of Hohenstaufen. The period covered does, however, extend from Charles of Anjou, a period roughly as long and as coherent as the 'Norman' monarchy of England between 1066 and 1204. Roger II's difficulties in creating an enduring kingdom needed continuous military effort. Even when these efforts were no longer required, the monarchy had still to learn how to function in lands where traditions of local government were strong. Yet when the monarchy itself faltered, the kingdom did not fall apart. Frederick II, the grandson of Roger II, showed that it could be revived and that his sons could maintain it. The ways in which the monarchy made itself indispensable cannot be traced in detail, but pointers to its success can be seen. The kingdom did not spring full-armed at birth - it took time and experience to hammer it into shape. When at last it looked capable of assuming the leadership of all Italy, its enemies combined to prevent it from doing so with the most profound consequences for Italy, the papacy and the west.",442,History,en,0521269113,norman kingdom

Beyond Borders Indo-Sasanian Trade and Its Central Indian Connections (Circa CE 300–700),Ashish Kumar,Springer Nature,2023-10-30,"This book examines the economic history of ancient South Asia by situating the Malwa region of Central India within Afro-Eurasian trade networks to illuminate the role of traders in the political, religious and economic processes connected with the Indo-Sasanian trade in the period of five centuries, circa CE 300-700. The book challenges the long-held centrality of the Roman factor in the South Asian economy by locating the Indo-Sasanian interactions in long distance economic networks with trade as a central feature. It considers the role and influence of traders as an understudied group affecting the contribution of the Indian economy to the world system. Amidst rapidly changing political landscapes, traders of Indian and Sasanian origins are studied as conscious political beings, who formed ties with varieties of polities and religious communities to secure their commercial interests. In addition, their commercial interactions with their Sogdian (Central Asia) and Aksumite (East Africa) counterparts are analyzed. The book also considers the nature of trade routes and the specific connections between mercantile and religious networks, including patterns of construction of religious shrines and temples along trade routes. Integrating epigraphic, numismatic, literary and archaeological evidence, this book moves away from a marginal treatment of the Indo-Sasanian trade in Indian history, and demonstrates how regional economic history must address a plurality of causes, actors, and processes in its assessment of the regional economy. The book will be of interest to students and academics of Indian economic history, as well as the ancient economies of South Asia more broadly.",260,Business & Economics,en,9783031435935,hephthalites

Nomadic Empires From Mongolia to the Danube,Gerard Chaliand,Routledge,2017-12-02,"""Nomadic Empires sheds new light on 2,000 years of military history and geopolitics. The Mongol Empire of Genghis-Khan and his heirs, as is well known, was the greatest empire in world history. For 2,000 from the fifth century b.c. to the fifteenth century a.d., the steppe areas of Asia, from the borders of Manchuria to the Black Sea, were a """"zone of turbulence,"""" threatening settled peoples from China to Russia and Hungary, including Iran, India, the Byzantine empire, and even Syria. It was a true world stage that was affected by these destructive nomads.This cogent, well-written volume examines these nomadic people, variously called Indo-Europeans, Turkic peoples, or Mongols. They did not belong to a sole nation or language, but shared a strategic culture born in the steppes: a highly mobile cavalry which did not require sophisticated logistics, and an indirect mode of combat based on surprise, mobility, and harassment.

Xiongnu The World's First Nomadic Empire,Bryan K. Miller,Oxford University Press,2024,"This book raises the case of the world's first nomadic empire, the Xiongnu, as a prime example of the sophisticated developments and powerful influence of nomadic regimes. Launching from a reconceptualization of the social and economic institutions of mobile pastoralists, the collective chapters trace the course of the Xiongnu Empire from before its initial rise, traversing the wars that challenged it and the reformations that made it stronger, to the legacy left after its eventual fall. Xiongnu expounds the economic practices and social conventions of steppe herders as fertile foundations for institutions and infrastructure of empire, and renders a model of ""empires of mobilities,"" which engaged the control less of towns and territories and more of the movements of communities and capital to fuel their regimes. By weaving together archaeological examinations with historical investigations, Bryan K. Miller presents a more complex and nuanced narrative of how an empire based firmly in the steppe over two thousand years ago managed to formulate a robust political economy and a complex political matrix that capitalized on mobilities and alternative forms of political participation, and allowed the Xiongnu to dominate vast realms of central Eurasia and leave lasting geopolitical effects on the many worlds around them.",385,History,en,9780190083694,nomadic empire

Islam in Process Historical and Civilizational Perspectives,"Jóhann Páll Árnason, Armando Salvatore",,2006,"The articles included in this Yearbook of the Sociology of Islam focus on two perspectives. Some link the comparative analysis of Islam to ongoing debates on the Axial Age and its role in the formation of major civilizations, while others are more concerned with historical constellations and sources involved in the formation of Islam as a religion and a civilization. More than any other particular line of inquiry, new historical and sociological approaches to the Axial Age have revived the idea of comparative civilizational analysis and channeled it into more specific projects. A closer look at the very problematic place of Islam in this context will help to clarify questions about the Axial version of civilizational theory as well as issues in Islamic studies and sociological approaches to modern Islam.

It also attempts, for the first time, to identify and locate the town of Kǔhán, which the Chinese historical chronicle, the Táng Shū (Book of the Tang Dynasty, 618–907 CE) describes as the ‘first capital’ of Shughnān. Many archaeological sites are examined and offered as potential candidates for the location of the town of Kǔhán, providing a foundation for future archaeological and ethnolinguistic research in the area. Ancient and Early Medieval Kingdoms of the Pamir Region of Central Asia: Historical Shughnān and its Lost Capital is suitable for students, scholars, and historians studying ancient and early medieval Central Asia, particularly the Pamir region, as well as those interested in Central Asian history and archaeology more broadly.",182,History,en,9781000825251,kidarites

Waves of nomadic migrations and the formation of steppe empires left their mark on political and social life. This multiethnic society had its roots in the great religious traditions of Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Christianity and Shamanism. The Islamization of a great part of the region brought fundamental changes to all aspects of life.

The Eastern Frontier Limits of Empire in Late Antique and Early Medieval Central Asia,Robert Haug,Bloomsbury Publishing,2019-06-27,"Transoxania, Khurasan, and ?ukharistan – which comprise large parts of today's Central Asia – have long been an important frontier zone. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the region was both an eastern political boundary for Persian and Islamic empires and a cultural border separating communities of sedentary farmers from pastoral-nomads. Given its peripheral location, the history of the 'eastern frontier' in this period has often been shown through the lens of expanding empires. However, in this book, Robert Haug argues for a pre-modern Central Asia with a discrete identity, a region that is not just a transitory space or the far-flung corner of empires, but its own historical entity. From this locally specific perspective, the book takes the reader on a 900-year tour of the area, from Sasanian control, through the Umayyads and Abbasids, to the quasi-independent dynasties of the Tahirids and the Samanids. Drawing on an impressive array of literary, numismatic and archaeological sources, Haug reveals the unique and varied challenges the eastern frontier presented to imperial powers that strove to integrate the area into their greater systems. This is essential reading for all scholars working on early Islamic, Iranian and Central Asian history, as well as those with an interest in the dynamics of frontier regions.",311,History,en,9781788317221,kidarites

'A rollercoaster of historical narration' History Today 'This is a history of epic scope that brings together the empires of the steppe land with the caravan cities of the Silk Road and imperial China' Martyn Rady, author of The Middle Kingdoms 'A sweeping account of forty-five centuries of nomadic tribes' Gillian Tett, Financial Times 'Flips the script to present the booted, felt-capped, leather-trousered and kaftan-wearing nomads as the bearers of civilisation . . . Harl's exhaustively researched book will ensure they rejoin the narrative of world history' Marc David Baer, Guardian The barbarian nomads of the Eurasian steppes played a decisive role in world history, but their achievements have gone largely unnoticed. These tribes produced some of the world's greatest conquerors: Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, among others. And their deeds still resonate today. Indeed, these nomads built long-lasting empires, facilitated the first global trade of the Silk Road and disseminated religions, technology, knowledge and goods of every description that enriched and changed the lives of so many across Europe, China and the Middle East. From a single region emerged a great many peoples – the Huns, the Mongols, the Magyars, the Turks, the Xiongnu, the Scythians, the Goths – all of whom went on to profoundly and irrevocably shape the modern world. In this enthralling new history, Professor Kenneth W. Harl draws on a lifetime of scholarship to vividly recreate the lives of these peoples from their beginnings to the early modern age. Their brutal struggle to survive on the steppes bred a resilient, pragmatic people ever-ready to learn from their neighbours. In warfare, they dominated the battlefield for over fifteen hundred years. Under charismatic rulers, they could topple empires and win their own.",577,History,en,9781526630445,alchon huns

Tauris,2008-03-15,"This latest volume in ""The Idea of Iran"" series concentrates on the Sasanian period. Seizing power from the previous dynasty - the Parthians - the Sasanians ruled Iran and most of the ancient Near East from 224 until 642 CE. They are particularly fascinating because of their adherence to Zoroastrianism, an ancient dualistic Iranian religion named after the prophet Zarathustra (or, in Greek, Zoroaster). The Sasanians expressed the divine aspect of their rule in a variety of forms, such as on coins, rock reliefs and silver plates, and architecture and the arts flourished under their aegis. Sasanian military success brought them into conflict with Rome, and later Byzantium. Their empire eventually collapsed under the force of the Arab army in AD 642, when Zoroastrianism was replaced with Islam.Engaging with all the major aspects of Sasanian culture, twelve eminent scholars address subjects which include: early Sasanian art and iconography; early Sasanian coinage; religion and identity in the Sasanian empire; later Sasanian orality and literacy; and state and society in late antique Iran. The volume in question arguably comprises the most complete and comprehensive treatment of the Sasanian civilization yet to be published in English.",200,Antiques & Collectibles,en,,alchon huns

Chinese Heritage Sites and their Audiences The Power of the Past,Rouran Zhang,Routledge,2020-03-17,"Chinese Heritage Sites and their Audiences provides a Chinese perspective on tourists’ relationship to heritage. Contributing to ongoing debates within heritage and tourism studies, the book offers insights into how and why visitors engage with such sites. Drawing on interviews with domestic tourists, local residents and heritage officials at the World Heritage sites of West Lake, Xidi and Hongcun, Zhang argues that tourists have agency: when they visit heritage sites, they are doing cultural, social and emotional work, whilst also negotiating cultural meanings. Providing an examination of the complex interactions between locals and tourists, the author then considers how tourists navigate and interpret heritage sites. Finally, Zhang examines whether the government or locally controlled tourism enterprises are more effective in facilitating meaningful cultural interaction between tourists and locals. Overall, the book demonstrates the interrelation between tourism and heritage, and the tensions that are created when the ways in which sites are used differ from the expectations of UNESCO and national or regional site managers. Chinese Heritage Sites and their Audiences pays particular attention to ongoing debates about heritage performances, the importance of emotions and the agency of tourists, and will thus appeal to academics and students engaged in the study of heritage, tourism, landscape architecture and anthropology.",234,Business & Economics,en,9780429863394,rouran

Theory of Bipolar World The Road to Communism Found in the Evolutionary Structure of World History,HUANG FENGLIN,FengLin Huang,2020-07-15,"This academic work, inheriting and developing the basic principles of Marxism, analyzes the world's historical structure by using materialist dialectics and forecasts the direction of the socialist movement and the ways to realize communism. It not only makes up for the horizontal dynamic part of Marxist theory but also points out a logical path for the development of human society. Furthermore, it predicts the proposal and practice of China's ""the Belt and Road Initiative"" from various aspects and provides the theoretical basis and rationale for building a community with a shared future for mankind. The theory about the contradictory movement between productive forces and production relations is the crucial part of Marxism and used to guide socialist revolution and construction as well as analyze world history. Nevertheless, classic writers failed to unveil their relations due to the historical limitations of materialist dialectics and lack of horizontal perspective to investigate the development of nature and human society. As a result, either productive forces or production relations are regarded as the only deciding factor in Marxist theory and practice, and the argument remains. This book, based on a large number of empirical analyses, solved the fundamental problem of historical materialism from the perspective of geographical competition. This book holds that after the invention of agriculture in the Neolithic Age, species competition was replaced by land-based geographic competition, which has become the fundamental driving force for the development of human society. It not only brought about private ownership and social organizations such as patriarchal clans, tribes, nationalities, classes, countries and regions, but also made the ""two poles"" of the East and the West compete in changing social forms, develop productive forces and shape world history after the formation of the Inner Asian nomads. This book divides the history of the ""bipolar"" competitions between the East and the West after 500 B.C. into three stages. The beginning of the first stage was marked by powerful feudalist China as the power core, ending with the rise of capitalist United Kingdom, which was the power core of the second stage. During this stage, with the acquisition of ""land taxes"" as its driving force, four relatively independent political-economic entities were formed from the East to the West with decreasing civilization degree: ancient China, Inner Asia, Islam and Europe (referred to as Zone 4, Zone 3, Zone 2 and Zone 1 respectively in this book). The second stage, with the capitalist UK as the power core, ended with the development of socialist China, which was the core of power at the third stage. The driving force at this stage was the attainment of ""raw material market."" Based on the first-generation bipolar world pattern, two relatively independent political-economic entities, the capitalist system and the socialist system, have been formed from the West to the East. This stage was divided into three phases of economic colonization, focusing on the realms of public goods, natural monopoly and competition. This book uses a large amount of historical data to analyze the specific levels of the two stages. Despite the fact that factual data support is not sufficient sometimes and some conclusions are open to discussion, the theoretical system is complete in line with macro events and the overall framework is convincing. By analyzing the first and second stages, this book makes a theoretical prediction about the phases and outcomes of the third stage. This book holds that the third stage began with the development of socialist China and will end with the realization of world communism and the extinction of geo-competitive relations. The driving force of this stage is the acquisition of ""property rights cooperation."" Based on the second-stage bipolar world pattern, it will undergo three phases of state-owned enterprises cooperation in the realm of competition, natural monopoly and public goods. The world, from east to west, will form an entity with no social difference. The author believes that under the background of the advantageous West and disadvantageous East in the economic globalization, a structural union based on geo-economy is the only option. Cross-border cooperation of state-owned enterprises is the only way to break the natural restriction of private economy, win the principal status in the world competition, solve the problem of sufficient demand at home and abroad, enhance the economic and political situation of the working class in various countries, and get rid of the dependence on the capitalist colonial system. The property right cooperation of state-owned enterprises, therefore, is the fundamental driving force for the future development of human society. This book sums up this historical process of economic cooperation as one driving force (the transnational property rights cooperation of state-owned enterprises), three phases (first Zones 4 and 3, then Zones 4, 3 and 2, and finally Zones 4, 3, 2 and 1) and three realms (first competition, then natural monopoly and finally public goods). The book was finalized in early 2013, and the Chinese version was published by the Central Compilation & Translation Press in March 2014. In September and October 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed to the world the initiative to jointly build the ""Silk Road Economic Belt"" and the ""21st Century Maritime Silk Road"". The Belt and Road Initiative, tracing its history back to the ancient Silk Road, aims to jointly build a community of shared interests, future and responsibilities through economic cooperation, featuring political mutual trust, economic integration and cultural tolerance. Since it is launched, the initiative has received extensive attention and recognition from the international community. It has achieved great success in solving China's own economic problems, providing sufficient supply to countries along the route, enhancing endogenous momentum in undeveloped countries, improving people's living standard and promoting the preservation and appreciation of surplus assets worldwide. We can see that when carrying out ""the Belt and Road Initiative,"" the property rights cooperation between state-owned enterprises of China and other countries along the line has played a crucial role. Countries in Zone 3, such as Russia, Inner Asia and Pakistan, have taken the lead in making significant progress in cooperation with China in Zone 4. Breakthroughs are achieved in competitive fields such as infrastructure, energy, manufacturing and trade. All these have proved the book's scientific predictions about the third stage. This book not only develops Marxist theory but also proves the scientific prophecy by the practice of the Belt and Road Initiative. Since the Chinese version was issued, it has received wide attention and recognition from all sides. When preparing the foreign language version, the author has dramatically compressed and modified the Chinese version of the content, making the book more complete and more readable.",415,Antiques & Collectibles,en,9798666390764,rouran
Scriptinformatics Extended Phenetic Approach to Script Evolution,Dr. habil. Gábor Hosszú,Nap Kiadó,2021-02-05,"Scripts (writing systems) usually belong to specific languages and have temporal, spatial and cultural characteristics. The evolution of scripts has been the subject of research for a long time. This is probably because the long-term development of human thinking is reflected in the surviving script relics, many of which are still undeciphered today. The book presents the study of the script evolution with the mathematical tools of systematics, phylogenetics and bioinformatics. In the research described, the script is the evolutionary taxonomic unit (taxon), which is analogous to the concept of biological species. Among the methods of phylogenetics, phenetics classifies the investigated taxa on the basis of their morphological similarity, and does not primarily examine genealogical relationships. Due to the scarcity of morphological diversity of scripts’ features, random coincidences of evolution-independent features are much more common in scripts than in biological species, thus phenetic modelling based solely on morphological features can lead to erroneous results. For this reason, phenetic modeling has been extended with evolutionary considerations, thereby allowing the modelling uncertainties observed in the script evolution to be addressed due to the large number of random coincidences (homoplasies) characterizing each script. The book describes an extended phenetic method developed to investigate the script evolution. This data-driven approach helps to reduce the impact of the uncertainties inherent in the phenetic model due to the large number of homoplasies that occur during the evolution of scripts. The elaborated phenetic and evolutionary analyses were applied to the Rovash scripts used on the Eurasian Steppe (Grassland), including the Turkic Rovash (Turkic Runic/runiform) and the Székely-Hungarian Rovash. The evaluation of the extended phenetic model of the scripts, the various phenograms, the script spectra and the group spectra helped to reconstruct the main ancestors and evolutionary stages of the investigated scripts.",338,Computers,en,9789633321782,rouran

From the Khitans to the Jurchens & Mongols A History of Barbarians in Triangle Wars & Quartet Conflicts,Hong Yuan,iUniverse,2022-11-14,"From the Khitans to the Jurchens & Mongols, A History of Barbarians in Triangle Wars & Quartet Conflicts is the third book of The Scourge of God Tetralogy. This is a book with comprehensive writeup of the barbarians’ history spanning more than one thousand years, from before the anno domini eras and inclusive of the expulsion of the Mongols from China. The subtitle about the barbarians in triangle wars & quartet conflicts is self-explanatory for the historical environment of different groups of barbarians successively rising up on the steppes to overpower the former with more savagery. This third book, while carrying a title with emphasis on the Khitans, the Jurchens and Mongols, also covered the Hsiung-nu (Huns), Hsien-pi (Xianbei), Tavghach (Tuoba), Juan-juan (Ruruans), Tu-chueh (Turks), Uygurs (Huihe), Kirghiz, Tibetans, Tanguts and southern barbarians. This book, being not merely about the barbarians, chronicled, without omission, an annalistic history of China’s dynasties including the Sui and Tang dynasties, the Five Dynasties, and the two Soong dynasties, with the interwoven theme of a civilization’s good fight against barbarism. There are many unique and groundbreaking contents, such as collation of the missing one-year history of the Mongols’ Central Asia campaigns and restitution of the unheard-of Mongol campaign in North Africa. This kind of discoveries is similar to this author’s trailblazing work done in other areas of sinology like rectifying the Huns’ war with the first Han dynasty emperor to 201 B.C. and correcting one year error in the Zhou dynasty’s interregnum (841-828 B.C. per Shi-ji/840-827 per Zhang Wenyu) in the duology The Sinitic Civilization.",1436,History,en,9781663242587,xianbei

Empires Beyond the Great Wall The Heritage of Genghis Khan,Adam Theodore Kessler,University of Washington Press,1993,"""From around 400 B.C. on, Chinese states began to erect defensive walls along portions of their northern border, and in the third century B.C., the Qin dynasty contructed a Great Wall, in large part by joining the older walls.

But the Great Wall is perhaps best understood as a demarcation of the frontier between two very different ways of life - the agrarian existence of central China and the pastoral nomadism of the steppelands to the north."" ""Although we have learned much about the steppe empires from the accounts of the sedentary societies that struggled with them, our knowledge has been greatly supplemented in recent years by the fieldwork of Chinese archaeologists, in particular those from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The truly astounding finds of the last several decades, which are represented in this book, give insight into the critical role that the ancient peoples of the north played in Chinese dynastic history. These priceless and beautiful artifacts also assist us in tracing East/West cultural diffusion along the Silk Road in the era prior to the perfecting of maritime travel."" ""As a result of collaboration between the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and the Inner Mongolia Museum of China, relics from the collections of ten Chinese museums are touring North America in 1994 and 1995. Through examination of the gold, bronze, ceramic, wood, and textile objects from cultures that flourished from 2000 B.C. through the fourteenth century A.D., Dr. Adam T. Kessler, curator of the exhibition and author of this book, reveals the complicated and often ferocious interactions of the steppe peoples with their sedentary neighbors to the south and west. The narrative gives perspective to the legends of the great Mongol leaders Genghis Khan and Kubilai Khan. But it also shows that the Mongols were but the last in a long series of empires to emerge from beyond the Great Wall and were truly inheritors of a rich past.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Horses in Asia,Bert G. Fragner,Austrian Academy of Sciences Press,2009,"English summary: Horses, horse-breeding and horse-keeping, as well as the trade in these animals played an important role in the history of Asia's pre- and early modern civilisations. However, horses were unequally distributed over the Asian continent and their acquisition was usually associated with different expectations. When the knowledge spread that horses could be profitably used in warfare as well as for overland transportation and for agriculture, this did not only promote trade relations, but also led to the emergence of new cultural links, often between distant sites, both by land and by sea. The contributions to this volume, twenty-one articles in all, are based on a conference entitled ""Horses in Asia"" that was organised by the Institute of Iranian Studies of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in October 2006.The articles are arranged into four regional sections: (1) Iran and West Asia, (2) Central Asia, (3) the Indian Ocean, (4) and China. They are complemented by a preface and two introductory essays. Each article takes its own approach, while, at the same time, opening doors to related academic fields, the main interest lying in the transfer of horses between different regions. German description: In der Geschichte der vor- und fruhmodernen Zivilisationen Asiens spielten Pferde - ihre Zucht und Haltung sowie der Handel mit ihnen - eine herausragende Rolle; sie waren in ungleicher Weise uber den gesamten asiatischen Kontinent verteilt, und ebenso unterschiedliche Erwartungen wurden an ihren Erwerb geknupft. Die Erkenntnis, dass sich Pferde militarisch, als Transportmittel und in der Landwirtschaft gewinnbringend einsetzen liessen, forderte nicht nur den Handel mit ihnen, sondern liess Pferde ganz allgemein zu einem wichtigen kulturellen Bindeglied zwischen Orten und Landern werden, die oftmals weit voneinander entfernt lagen, sowohl uber Land wie uber den Seeweg. Die hier vorgestellten einundzwanzig Beitrage sind das Ergebnis einer gleichnamigen Tagung, die im Oktober 2006 auf Einladung des Instituts fur Iranistik der Osterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften durchgefuhrt wurde. Sie sind nach Regionen geordnet: (1) Iran und Westasien, (2) Zentralasien, (3) Indischer Ozean (4) und China. Erganzt werden sie durch ein Vorwort und zwei einfuhrende Artikel.

Hungarians and Europe in the Early Middle Ages An Introduction to Early Hungarian History,András Róna-Tas,Central European University Press,1999-03-01,"Lavishly illustrated, the book contains seventy five historical maps and colour plates which visualize the historical background of Hungary and introduces its early history to a broader readership. The early history of Hungarians is embedded into the history of Eurasia and special attention is given to the relationship of the Hungarians with the Khazars and the Bulghar-Turks. The first part deals with methods and sources which can be used for elucidating the ancient history of the Hungarians, relying on research into linguistics, archaeology, anthropology and natural history. The second part traces how the Hungarians came into the Carpathian Basin and answers such questions as: who are the Magyars, from where did they come and how did they conquer the land? It reconstructs and examines their early political and social structure, the economy, and religion, and compares the Hungarian medieval process with the ethnogenetic processes of the Germanic, Slavic and Turkic people.",610,History,en,,xiongnu

"The Sinitic Civilization Book II A Factual History Through the Lens of Archaeology, Bronzeware, Astronomy, Divination, Calendar and the Annals",Hong Yuan,iUniverse,2018-11-14,"The Sinitic Civilization A Factual History through the Lens of Archaeology, Bronzeware, Astronomy, Divination, Calendar and the Annals The book covered the time span of history of the Sinitic civilization from antiquity, to the 3rd millennium B.C. to A.D. 85. A comprehensive review of history related to the Sinitic cosmological, astronomical, astrological, historical, divinatory, and geographical developments was given. All ancient Chinese calendars had been examined, with the ancient thearchs’ dates examined from the perspective how they were forged or made up. The book provides the indisputable evidence regarding the fingerprint of the forger for the 3rd century A.D. book Shang-shu (remotely ancient history), and close to 50 fingerprints of the forger of the contemporary version of The Bamboo Annals. Using the watershed line of Qin Emperor Shihuangdi’s book burning of 213 B.C., the book rectified what was the original history before the book burning, filtered out what was forged after the book burning, sorted out the sophistry and fables that were rampant just prior to the book burning, and validated the history against the records in the oracle bones, bronzeware, and bamboo slips. The book covers 95-98% and more of the contents in the two ancient history annals of The Spring Autumn Annals and The Bamboo Annals. There are dedicated chapters devoted to interpreting Qu Yuan’s poem Asking Heaven (Tian Wen), the mythical book The Legends of Mountains & Seas (Shan Hai Jing), geography book Lord Yu’s Tributes (Yu Gong), and Zhou King Muwang’s Travelogue (Mu-tian-zi Zhuan). The book has appendices of two calendars: the first anterior quarter remainder calendar (247 B.C.-104 B.C./247 B.C.-85 A.D.) of the Qin Empire, as well as a conversion table of the sexagenary years of the virtual Yin-li (Shang dynasty) quarter remainder calendar versus the Gregorian calendar, that covers the years 2698 B.C. to 2018 A.D. Book I stops about the midpoint of the 242 years covered in Confucius’ abridged book The Spring & Autumn Annals (722-481 B.C.). Book II stops at Han Emperor Zhangdi (Liu Da, reign A.D. 76-88; actual reign Aug of A.D. 75-Feb of A.D. 88), with the A.D. 85 adoption of the Sifen-li posterior quarter remainder calendar premised on reverting to the sexagenary years of the virtual Yin-li (Shang dynasty) quarter remainder calendar, a calendar disconnected from the Jupiter’s chronogram, that was purportedly invented by the Confucians on basis of Confucius’ identifying the ‘qi-lin’ divine giraffe animal and wrapping up the masterpiece The Spring & Autumn Annals two years prior to death.",852,Social Science,en,9781532058318,yuezhi

Indo-European Origins The Anthropological Evidence,John V.

The author first considers the various ways that languages can spread and the possible biological implications of these expansions. He then embarks on an exhaustive survey of over 2,600 books and articles relating to the physical anthropology of the earliest identified speakers of Indo-European languages, based on ancient texts, artworks and lexicons. Covering Europe and Asia from the Neolithic onwards, His study surveys dermatoglyphics, mummified corpses, skeletal remains and genetic material for evidence of ancient population movements. An attempt is then made to integrate findings from biological anthropology with data from linguistics, archaeology and social anthropology to test the validity of migration theories in relation to the dispersal of the Indo-European languages and the possible location of a hypothecated proto-Indo-European language.

The Persian Empire A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes],Mehrdad Kia,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2016-06-27,"This well-balanced reference on ancient Persia demonstrates the region's contributions to the growth and development of human civilization from the 7th century BCE through the fall of the Persian Sasanian Empire in 651CE. Knowledge of ancient Persia is often gleaned from the writings of the ancient Greeks and Romans—two civilizations that viewed the Persians as enemies. This one-of-a-kind reference provides unbiased coverage of the cultural history of the Persian Empire, examining the Median, Achaemenid, Parthian, Kushan, and Sasanian dynasties and tracing the development and maturation of Iranian societies during a period of nearly 1,500 years. As one of the most comprehensive studies on the topic, this historical overview explores the region's rich past while providing insight into the cultures and civilizations the Persians came to rule and influence. Using primary sources written and inscribed by the ancient Persians themselves, the encyclopedia studies the pre-Islamic civilizations of Iran in the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Incorporating contributions from scholars who discuss the rise and fall of various Persian dynasties, the work offers some 180 entries that cover such topics as religion, royal nobility, the caste system, and political assassinations. The content offers perspectives from a variety of disciplines—from anthropology to archaeology, geography, and art history, among other areas.",784,History,en,9798216127727,persian empire

Assuming no prior background, this accessible textbook follows the dynastic line from the establishment and expansion of the empire under the early Achaemenid kings to its collapse in 330 BCE. The text integrates the latest research, key primary sources, and archaeological data to offer readers deep insights into the empire, its kings, and its people. Chronologically organized chapters contain written, archaeological, and visual sources that highlight key learning points, stimulate discussion, and encourage readers to evaluate specific pieces of evidence. Throughout the text, author Maria Brosius emphasizes the necessity to critically assess Greek sources—highlighting how their narrative of Achaemenid political historyoften depicted stereotypical images of the Persians rather than historical reality. Topics include the establishment of empire under Cyrus the Great, Greek-Persian relations, the creation of a Persian ruling class, the bureaucracy and operation of the empire, Persian diplomacy and foreign policy, and the reign of Darius III. This innovative textbook: Offers a unique approach to Achaemenid history, considering both archaeological and literary sources Places primary Persian and Near Eastern sources in their cultural, political, and historical context Examines material rarely covered in non-specialist texts, such as royal inscriptions, Aramaic documents, and recent archaeological finds Features a comprehensive introduction to Achaemenid geography, Greek historiography, and modern scholarship on the Persian War Part of the acclaimed Blackwell History of the Ancient Worldseries, A History of the Achaemenid Empire is a perfect primary textbook for courses in Ancient History, Near Eastern Studies, and Classical Civilizations, as well as an invaluable resource for general readers with interest in the history of empires, particularly the first Persian empire or Iranian civilization.",287,History,en,9781119702542,persian empire

A Companion to the Achaemenid Persian Empire offers a perspective in which the history of the empire is embedded in the preceding and subsequent epochs. In this way, the traditions that shaped the Achaemenid Empire become as visible as the powerful impact it had on further historical development. But the work does not only break new ground in this respect, but also in the fact that, in addition to written testimonies of all kinds, it also considers material tradition as an equal factor in historical reconstruction. This comprehensive two-volume set features contributions by internationally-recognized experts that offer balanced coverage of the whole of the empire from Anatolia and Egypt across western Asia to northern India and Central Asia. Comprehensive in scope, the Companion provides readers with a panoramic view of the diversity, richness, and complexity of the Achaemenid Empire, dealing with all the many aspects of history, event history, administration, economy, society, communication, art, science and religion, illustrating the multifaceted nature of the first true empire.

The book deftly intertwines narrative and analysis, employing a scholarly style that is both accessible and engaging. Rawlinson's work is anchored in the context of the 19th century, a period marked by a growing Western interest in Eastern cultures and a revival of classical studies, making his narrative rich with both historical insights and contemporary reflections.

King and Court in Ancient Persia 559 to 331 BCE,Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones,Edinburgh University Press,2013-01-14,"The first Persian Empire (559-331 BCE) was the biggest land empire the world had seen, and seated at the heart of its vast dominions, in the south of modern-day Iran, was the person of the Great King. Immortalized in Greek literature as despotic tyrants, a new vision of Persian monarchy is emerging from Iranian, and other, sources (literary, visual, and archaeological), which show the Kings in a very different light. Inscriptions of Cyrus, Darius, Xerxes, and their heirs present an image of Persian rulers as liberators, peace-makers, valiant warriors, righteous god-fearing judges, and law-makers.Around them the Kings established lavish and sophisticated courts, the centres of political decision-making and cultural achievements in which the image of monarchy was endorsed and advanced by an almost theatrical display of grandeur and power.This book explores the representation of Persian monarchy and the court of the Achaemenid Great Kings from the point of view of the ancient Iranians themselves and th",289,History,en,9780748677108,persian empire
From Cyrus to Alexander A History of the Persian Empire,Pierre Briant,Eisenbrauns,2002-01-01,"Around 550 B.C.E. the Persian people--who were previously practically unknown in the annals of history--emerged from their base in southern Iran (Fars) and engaged in a monumental adventure that, under the leadership of Cyrus the Great and his successors, culminated in the creation of an immense Empire that stretched from central Asia to Upper Egypt, from the Indus to the Danube. The Persian (or Achaemenid, named for its reigning dynasty) Empire assimilated an astonishing diversity of lands, peoples, languages, and cultures. This conquest of Near Eastern lands completely altered the history of the world: for the first time, a monolithic State as vast as the future Roman Empire arose, expanded, and matured in the course of more than two centuries (530-330) and endured until the death of Alexander the Great (323), who from a geopolitical perspective was ""the last of the Achaemenids."" Even today, the remains of the Empire-the terraces, palaces, reliefs, paintings, and enameled bricks of Pasargadae, Persepolis, and Susa; the impressive royal tombs of Naqsh-i Rustam; the monumental statue of Darius the Great-serve to remind visitors of the power and unprecedented luxury of the Great Kings and their loyal courtiers (the ""Faithful Ones""). Though long eclipsed and overshadowed by the towering prestige of the ""ancient Orient"" and ""eternal Greece,"" Achaemenid history has emerged into fresh light during the last two decades. Freed from the tattered rags of ""Oriental decadence"" and ""Asiatic stagnation,"" research has also benefited from a continually growing number of discoveries that have provided important new evidence-including texts, as well as archaeological, numismatic, and iconographic artifacts. The evidence that this book assembles is voluminous and diverse: the citations of ancient documents and of the archaeological evidence permit the reader to follow the author in his role as a historian who, across space and time, attempts to understand how such an Empire emerged, developed, and faded. Though firmly grounded in the evidence, the author's discussions do not avoid persistent questions and regularly engages divergent interpretations and alternative hypotheses. This book is without precedent or equivalent, and also offers an exhaustive bibliography and thorough indexes. The French publication of this magisterial work in 1996 was acclaimed in newspapers and literary journals. Now Histoire de l'Empire Perse: De Cyrus a Alexandre is translated in its entirety in a revised edition, with the author himself reviewing the translation, correcting the original edition, and adding new documentation. Pierre Briant, Chaire Histoire et civilisation du monde achémenide et de l'empire d'Alexandre, Collège de France, is a specialist in the history of the Near East during the era of the Persian Empire and the conquests of Alexander.

To this day, he still inspires us thanks to his tolerance and eloquent ruling. He was a pioneer of human rights and laid out rules that spearheaded freedom and equality. Cyrus was recognized as a polytheist who favored worshipping many gods at a time. He turned from one god to another, according to his agenda and circumstances. He prayed to a god who could fulfill his desire and lead him to victory, which was noted during his rule in Babylonia. The former Babylonian ruler did not allow his people to worship their god and imposed hard labor, making life unbearable for thousands, but when Cyrus overtook the throne, he allowed Babylonia's people to follow their religion and worship their god, which increased their trust and admiration in Cyrus.",82,History,en,,persian empire

Safavid Iran Rebirth of a Persian Empire,Andrew J.

The Safavids witnessed wide-ranging developments in politics, warfare, science, philosophy, religion, art and architecture. But how did this dynasty manage to produce the longest lasting and most glorious of Iran's Islamic-period eras?Andrew Newman offers a complete re-evaluation of the Safavid place in history as they presided over these extraordinary developments and the wondrous flowering of Iranian culture. In the process, he dissects the Safavid story, from before the 1501 capture of Tabriz by Shah Ismail (1488-1524), the point at which Shiism became the realm's established faith; on to the sixteenth and early seventeenth century dominated by Shah Abbas (1587-1629), whose patronage of art and architecture from his capital of Isfahan embodied the Safavid spirit; and culminating with the reign of Sultan Husayn (reg. 1694-1722).Based on meticulous scholarship, Newman offers a valuable new interpretation of the rise of the Safavids and their eventual demise in the eighteenth century.

The Fourth Crusade Event and Context,Michael J Angold,Routledge,2015-11-17,The Fourth Crusade (1202-4) was one of the key events in medieval history The fall of Constantinople to the Venetians and the soldiers of the fourth crusade in April 1204 was its climax. It ensured that Byzantium’s days as a great power were over. It equally ensured that westerners would dominate the Levant – the lands of the old Byzantine Empire –until the end of the middle ages. This book asks just how important was the Fourth as a turning point in the Middle East.. The broad setting is the encounter of Byzantium with the West within the framework of the crusades. Differences of outlook and interest meant that this encounter was soon overburdened with mutual distrust. 1204 was some kind of a solution and created situations scarcely conceivable even two years before when the fourth crusade set sail from Venice.,304,History,en,9781317880554,latin empire

New Perspectives on the Roman Civil Wars of 49–30 BCE,"Richard Westall, Hannah Cornwell",Bloomsbury Publishing,2024-01-25,"Offering new and original approaches to the Roman civil wars of 49-30 BCE, the eleven papers presented here for the first time shed light on this crucial moment in the forging of Roman identity. They engage with a variety of problems and topics in political discourse (diplomacy, the concept of libertas, divine paternity); socio-economic structures (allied rulers, military officials, civil war finances, Agrippa's family); material culture (the coinage of Julius Caesar, the physical remains of Corfinium); and literary commemoration (Sallust on trauma, the lost Histories of Asinius Pollio). The case studies presented here contribute to our understanding of a period that is just as fundamental for our view of the Romans as it was to the Romans themselves. Arguing for the unity of the period in question, the volume deploys a multiplicity of methodologies to analyse how the trauma of armed conflict and the breakdown of accepted socio-cultural models not only mediated the contemporary experience of Roman civil war, but also left a lasting impression upon how Romans viewed the world. Incisive and critical, these contributions by a diverse team of international researchers, both emerging scholars and leaders in their fields, offer a new window into the world of the late Republic and early Principate.",244,History,en,9781350272491,roman civil wars

The study of the late Republican civil wars can be productively read as an exercise of ‘connected history’, in which the fundamental interdependence of the Mediterranean world comes to the fore through a set of case studies that await to be understood through a properly integrative approach. Our project brings together an international and diverse lineup of scholars, who engage with a wide range of literary, documentary, and archaeological material, and make a collective contribution to the reframing of a problem that requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary outlook, and can yield invaluable insights to the understanding of the Roman imperial project.",290,History,en,9783111431772,roman civil wars

Caesar's Legacy Civil War and the Emergence of the Roman Empire,Josiah Osgood,Cambridge University Press,2006-02-16,"In April 44 BC the eighteen-year-old Gaius Octavius landed in Italy and launched his take-over of the Roman world.

Caesar's Legacy grippingly retells the story of Augustus' rise to power by focusing on how the bloody civil wars which he and his soldiers fought transformed the lives of men and women throughout the Mediterranean world and beyond. During this violent period citizens of Rome and provincials came to accept a new form of government and found ways to celebrate it.

Ancient Rome The Great Roman Civil War,Victor Miller,,2016-02-28,"Gaius Julius Caesar cut a twenty-year swath across Europe, Africa, and Asia, the result of which was the end of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. He was one of the first Romans to ever set foot in Germany, took the capital city of Rome with no bloodshed, installed Cleopatra to power, and was so feared that many of his bitterest enemy's chose suicide, rather than face him in battle. Caesar was a brilliant tactician, but was also an extremely lucky guy, and Ancient Rome: The Great Roman Civil War goes to great lengths to frankly discuss which victories during the five years of the Second Roman Civil War were which. You will be surprised to learn just how often Caesar found himself in an untenable situation that would have spelled disaster had one of his enemies just pushed an advantage. Despite this fact, Caesar's brilliant tactical mind always found a way out of even the darkest situations, and this book provides as much information on each battle as is currently available in the modern world. Gaius Julius Caesar was a brilliant tactician, and the five years covered in detail within detail his greatest efforts. Inside you will find a detailed discussion of the following battles: The Siege of Dyrrachium The Battle of Pharsalus The Siege of Alexandria The Battle of the Nile The Battle of Zela The Battle of Ruspina The Siege of Thapsus And More...",66,,en,1530300762,roman civil wars
"Fighting for Rome Poets and Caesars, History and Civil War",John Henderson,Cambridge University Press,1998-03-12,"The essays in Fighting for Rome confront the traumatic disjunction between the militarist culture of classical Rome, with its heavy investment in valour, conquest and triumph, and the domination of its history by civil war, where Roman soldiers killed so many Romans for control of Rome. The essays gathered and rewritten here range across the literary forms (history, satire, lyric and epic) and work closely with the ancient texts (Appian and Julius Caesar; Horace; Lucan and Statius; Tacitus and Livy). Close reading and powerful translation communicate the ancient writers' efforts to grasp and respond to the Roman civil wars, and to their product, Roman terror under the Caesars. The book aims to bring to life strong reactions to a world order run by civil war.",376,History,en,0521580269,roman civil wars
The Roman Civil Wars The Archaeology and History of a Crisis,DOMINIK. MASCHEK,,2025-04-28,"The late Roman Republic was characterized by severe crises, ranging from the time of the Gracchi to the Battle of Actium and finally ending with the Principate of Augustus. Individual military leaders such as Marius, Sulla, and Pompey acquired so much power that the internal cohesion of the Republic was shattered. The Roman state descended into civil war. By drawing upon a range of case studies, from monumental building to public dining, Dominik Maschek demonstrates that the harsh realities and disruptions of civil war were intimately bound up with growing wealth and prosperity: on the one hand, they were fueled by the increasing complexity of urban life and conspicuous consumption which gave rise to greed and violent appropriation; on the other hand, by the forceful and premature promotion of new 'controlling generations', they also played a vital role in conditioning the worldviews and socio-cultural norms that regulated the use of material culture. Drawing upon the latest advances in Roman archaeology and history, Dominik Maschek uses buildings and images, as well as rituals and acts of state, to analyze these structural underpinnings and the impact of the late Republican civil wars and for the first time offers an overall interpretation of their cultural history.",0,History,en,1836243383,roman civil wars
Connected Histories of the Roman Civil Wars (88–30 BCE),"David García Domínguez, Juan García González, Federico Santangelo",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2024-11-04,"This book offers a distinctive take on the civil wars that unfolded in the Late Roman Republic. It frames their discussion against the backdrop of the Mediterranean contexts in which they were fought, and sets out to bring to the centre of the debate the significance of provincial agency on a traumatic and complex process, which cannot be understood through an exclusive focus on Roman and Italian developments. The study of the late Republican civil wars can be productively read as an exercise of ‘connected history’, in which the fundamental interdependence of the Mediterranean world comes to the fore through a set of case studies that await to be understood through a properly integrative approach. Our project brings together an international and diverse lineup of scholars, who engage with a wide range of literary, documentary, and archaeological material, and make a collective contribution to the reframing of a problem that requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary outlook, and can yield invaluable insights to the understanding of the Roman imperial project.",381,History,en,9783111432144,roman civil wars
Caesar's Civil War 49–44 BC,Adrian Goldsworthy,Bloomsbury Publishing,2014-06-06,"Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great were two of the greatest generals Rome had ever produced. Together they had brought vast stretches of territory under Roman dominion. In 49 BC they turned against each other and plunged Rome into civil war. Legion was pitched against legion in a vicious battle for political domination of the vast Roman world. Based on original sources, Adrian Goldsworthy provides a gripping account of this desperate power struggle. The armies were evenly matched but in the end Caesar's genius as a commander and his great good luck brought him victory in 45 BC.",125,History,en,9781472809889,roman civil wars
Caesar's Civil War Historical Reality and Fabrication,Richard W. Westall,BRILL,2017-11-20,"In Caesar's Civil War: Historical Reality and Fabrication, Westall combines literary analysis of Caesar’s Bellum Civile with a concern for the socio-economic history of the Roman empire. The Bellum Gallicum and the Shakespearean play are better known, but Caesar’s partisan account of the Roman civil war culminating in the battle of Pharsalus offers a historical text of perennial interest and relevance. Two introductory chapters contextualize this book and offer a traditional narrative of political and military history for 49-48 BCE. There follow seven chapters that are dedicated to each of the geographical theatres of civil war. These chapters show how Caesar’s testimony sheds important light upon the nature of Roman rule in the Mediterranean, but also explore the problems to be encountered in using potentially tendentious testimony.",416,Literary Criticism,en,9789004356153,roman civil wars
After 69 CE - Writing Civil War in Flavian Rome,"Lauren Donovan Ginsberg, Darcy Anne Krasne",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2018-12-17,"The fall of Nero and the civil wars of 69 CE ushered in an era scarred by the recent conflicts; Flavian literature also inherited a rich tradition of narrating nefas from its predecessors who had confronted and commemorated the traumas of Pharsalus and Actium. Despite the present surge of scholarly interest in both Flavian literary studies and Roman civil war literature, however, the Flavian contribution to Rome’s literature of bellum ciuile remains understudied. This volume shines a spotlight on these neglected voices. In the wake of 69 CE, writing civil war became an inescapable project for Flavian Rome: from Statius’s fraternas acies and Silius’s suicidal Saguntines to the internecine narratives detailed in Josephus’s Bellum Iudaicum and woven into Frontinus’s exempla, Flavian authors’ preoccupation with civil war transcends genre and subject matter. This book provides an important new chapter in the study of Roman civil war literature by investigating the multi-faceted Flavian response to this persistent and prominent theme.",634,Literary Criticism,en,9783110584745,roman civil wars
The Civil Wars,Appian,Mint Editions,2021-06-21,"The Civil Wars (c. 150) is a work of political and military history by Appian. Written toward the end of his career as a leading advocate in Rome, The Civil Wars is comprised of books 13-17 of The Roman History, Appian's 24-book study of the Roman Republic and Empire. Appian's work has long been considered essential by classical scholars and historians alike, providing an effective and largely objective overview of the most turbulent period in the history of Rome. In the decades after the assassinations of the Gracchi brothers--tribunes who attempted to enact sweeping reforms in favor of the poor and veterans--the Roman Republic erupts in a series of violent civil wars. From 88-81 BC, Sullan and Marian forces waged two wars dividing the country between the Optimates--Sulla's political faction--and the Populares, controlled by Marius. In 81 BC, the victorious Sulla declared himself Dictator of the Republic, leading to a period of executions and political repression of those declared enemies of the state. Years later, in 60 BC, the First Triumvirate between Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey shifts power from the Optimates back to the Populares, creating tension between the Roman Senate and the Republic's leading generals and elected officials. As Caesar's military victories and acquisition of new territories give him increasing power and popularity, Pompey aligns himself with the Senate. In an act of stunning defiance, Caesar crosses the Rubicon with his army in 49 BC, setting off a four-year civil war that will conclude with Caesar declaring himself Dictator for life, virtually ending the Roman Republic after nearly five centuries of existence. Accessible and elegantly paced, Appian's The Civil Wars is an invaluable work from one of the Roman Empire's leading historians. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Appian's The Civil Wars is a classic of Roman history reimagined for modern readers.",174,,en,1513132695,roman civil wars
New Perspectives on the Roman Civil Wars of 49–30 BCE,"Richard Westall, Hannah Cornwell",Bloomsbury Publishing,2024-01-25,"Offering new and original approaches to the Roman civil wars of 49-30 BCE, the eleven papers presented here for the first time shed light on this crucial moment in the forging of Roman identity. They engage with a variety of problems and topics in political discourse (diplomacy, the concept of libertas, divine paternity); socio-economic structures (allied rulers, military officials, civil war finances, Agrippa's family); material culture (the coinage of Julius Caesar, the physical remains of Corfinium); and literary commemoration (Sallust on trauma, the lost Histories of Asinius Pollio). The case studies presented here contribute to our understanding of a period that is just as fundamental for our view of the Romans as it was to the Romans themselves. Arguing for the unity of the period in question, the volume deploys a multiplicity of methodologies to analyse how the trauma of armed conflict and the breakdown of accepted socio-cultural models not only mediated the contemporary experience of Roman civil war, but also left a lasting impression upon how Romans viewed the world. Incisive and critical, these contributions by a diverse team of international researchers, both emerging scholars and leaders in their fields, offer a new window into the world of the late Republic and early Principate.",249,History,en,9781350272484,roman civil wars

Appian's Roman History Empire and Civil War,Kathryn Welch,Classical Press of Wales,2015-08-31,"Appian of Alexandria lived in the early-to-mid second century AD, a time when the pax Romana flourished. His Roman History traced, through a series of ethnographic histories, the growth of Roman power throughout Italy and the Mediterranean World. But Appian also told the story of the civil wars which beset Rome from the time of Tiberius Gracchus to the death of Sextus Pompeius Magnus. The standing of his work in modern times is paradoxical. Consigned to the third rank by nineteenth-century historiographers, and poorly served by translators, Appian's Roman History profoundly shapes our knowledge of Republican Rome, its empire and its internal politics. We need to know him better. This collection of 15 new papers from a distinguished international team studies both what Appian had to say and how he said it. The papers engage in a dialogue about the value of Appian's text as a source of history, the relationship between that history and his own times, and the impact on his narrative of the author's own opinions - most notably that Rome enjoyed divinely-ordained good fortune. Some authors demonstrate that Appian's text (and even his mistakes) can yield significant new information, others re-open the question of Appian's use of source material in the light of recent studies showing him to be far more than a transmitter of other people's work.",404,History,en,9781910589113,roman civil wars

This is not just another arid chronological list of battles, their winners and their losers. Using a wide range of literary and archaeological evidence, Paul Chrystal offers a rare insight into the wars, battles and politics of this most turbulent and consequential of ancient world centuries; in so doing, it gives us an eloquent and exciting political, military and social history of ancient Rome during one of its most cataclysmic and crucial periods, explaining why and how the civil wars led to the establishment of one of the greatest empires the world has known. “More than a list of battles, their winners and losers.

The U.S. Army and World War II Selected Papers from the Army's Commemorative Conferences,Judith Bellafaire,U.S. Government Printing Office,1998,"The U.S. Army and World War II is an anthology of selected papers from three international conferences held in 1990, 1992, and 1994 on the Army's role in the war. Taking the best from those meetings, Judith L. Bellafaire has organized the various presentations into four thematic categories--prewar planning, the home front, the European theater, and the Asian-Pacific theaters--reflecting the diversity of both the war and the interest of those seeking to understand its many facets. In these carefully edited papers, one will find the more conventional treatments of doctrine, strategy, and operations side by side with those focusing on military mobilization and procurement, race and gender, psychological warfare, and large-scale advice and assistance programs. Despite significant changes in military technology and the geopolitical landscape of the world since those desperate times, the human problems highlighted by the authors are not much different from many of those facing Army leaders today. Although the past can never provide the specific recipes needed for the future, experience has shown that both the basic ingredients and the manner in which they are prepared and processed have remained remarkably constant. Those grappling with the challenges of stability operations and other contingency missions in support of the Global War on Terrorism will find this collection of readings invaluable.",436,History,en,,crossing of the rhine
The Rhine Crossing Twelfth Army Group Engineer Operations,Patrick Henry Timothy,,1946,"The Rhine Crossing, which was almost completely an ""engineer show,"" is an excellent illustration of the work of our engineers in Europe. With the possible exception of the Normandy beaches, the Rhine River presented the most formidable natural obstacle in western Europe. From the standpoint of troops and equipment involved, the assault crossing of the Rhine was the largest military operation in history. It is questionable whether the vast extent and scope of the engineer studies and plans prepared in connection with an operation of this magnitude will ever be adequately described. This pamphlet attempts only to outline the work of the engineers of the Twelfth Army Group in preparation for the Rhine crossing, and to indicate the major accomplishments during the actual operation. However, an operation of such gigantic proportions could not have been successful without full cooperation from all arms and services. Emphasis will also be placed on the unique features of this undertaking. For instance, the idea of employing the Navy on the Rhine was conceived by engineers of the Twelfth Army Group and for the first time in history a part of our Navy was transported several hundred miles overland and launched on an inland waterway to support a river crossing. Contents include the situation, problem, preparation, and the actual crossing. -- Abstract.",98,Military engineering,en,,crossing of the rhine

The Way of the Barbarians Redrawing Ethnic Boundaries in Tang and Song China,Shao-yun Yang,University of Washington Press,2019-10-14,"Shao-yun Yang challenges assumptions that the cultural and socioeconomic watershed of the Tang-Song transition (800–1127 CE) was marked by a xenophobic or nationalist hardening of ethnocultural boundaries in response to growing foreign threats. In that period, reinterpretations of Chineseness and its supposed antithesis, “barbarism,” were not straightforward products of political change but had their own developmental logic based in two interrelated intellectual shifts among the literati elite: the emergence of Confucian ideological and intellectual orthodoxy and the rise of neo-Confucian (daoxue) philosophy. New discourses emphasized the fluidity of the Chinese-barbarian dichotomy, subverting the centrality of cultural or ritual practices to Chinese identity and redefining the essence of Chinese civilization and its purported superiority. The key issues at stake concerned the acceptability of intellectual pluralism in a Chinese society and the importance of Confucian moral values to the integrity and continuity of the Chinese state. Through close reading of the contexts and changing geopolitical realities in which new interpretations of identity emerged, this intellectual history engages with ongoing debates over relevance of the concepts of culture, nation, and ethnicity to premodern China.",243,History,en,9780295746012,barbarian rulers

Initially renowned for his pioneering work on the structure of power in early imperial China, he is more widely known for expanding the horizons of Chinese history to include the histories of the Chinese and their descendents outside China. It is probably no coincidence, Philip Kuhn observes, that the most comprehensive historian of the Overseas Chinese is the historian most firmly grounded in the history of China itself. This book is a celebration of the life, work, and impact of Professor Wang Gungwu over the past four decades. It commemorates his contribution to the study of Chinese history and the abiding influence he has exercised over later generations of historians, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The book begins with an historiographical survey by Philip Kuhn (Francis Lee Higginson Professor of History at Harvard University) of Wang Gungwu's enduring contribution to scholarship. It concludes with an engaging oral history of Professor Wang's life, career, and research trajectory. The intervening chapters explore many of the fields in which Wang Gungwu's influence has been felt over the years, including questions of political authority, national identity, commercial life, and the history of the diaspora from imperial times to the present day.

"The Cultural Power of Medieval Monarchy Politics, Learning and Patronage in the Royal Courts of Europe, 1000–1300",Manuel Alejandro Rodríguez de la Peña,Taylor & Francis,2023-09-22,"This book focuses on why the diffusion of the political theology of royal wisdom created “Solomonic” princes with intellectual interests all around the medieval West and how these learned rulers changed the face of Western Europe through their policies and the cultural power of medieval monarchy. Princely wisdom narratives have been seen simply as a tool of royal propaganda in the Middle Ages but these narratives were much more than propaganda, being rather a coherent ideology which transformed princely courts, shaped mentalities, and influenced key political decisions. This cultural power of medieval monarchy was channelled mainly through princely patronage of learning and the arts, but the rise of administrative monarchy and its bureaucracy are equally related to these policies. This can only be understood through a cultural approach to the history of medieval politics, that is, a history of the relationship between knowledge and power in the Middle Ages, a topic much analyzed regarding the medieval church but sometimes neglected in the princely sphere. This volume is a study that supplies an important comparative study of the reception in princely courts of a key aspect of European medieval civilization: The ideal of Christian sapiential rulership and its corollary, rationality in government. This volume is essential reading for students and scholars interested in understanding the medieval roots of the cultural process which gave rise to the modern state.",283,History,en,9781000959000,barbarian rulers

Abdale,Casemate Publishers,2019-06-30,"The little-known story of a fierce rebellion against the Romans:“A very good read for anyone interested in ancient military history and historiography.” —The NYMAS Review In the year AD 9, three Roman legions were crushed by the German warlord Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. This event is well known, but there was another uprising that Rome faced shortly before, which lasted from AD 6 to 9, and was just as intense. This rebellion occurred in the western Balkans—an area roughly corresponding to modern Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, and parts of Serbia and Albania—and it tested the Roman Empire to its limits. For three years, fifteen legions fought in the narrow valleys and forest-covered crags of the Dinaric Mountains in a ruthless war of attrition against an equally ruthless and determined foe, and yet this conflict is largely unknown today. The Great Illyrian Revolt is believed to be the first book ever devoted to this forgotten war of the Roman Empire.

Life in a Medieval Castle and Life in a Medieval City, both by Joseph and Frances Gies.” —George R. R.

In Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages, acclaimed historians Frances and Joseph Gies trace the development of marriage and the family from the medieval era to early modern times. It describes how the Roman and barbarian cultural streams merged under the influence of the Christian church to forge new concepts, customs, laws, and practices. Century by century, the Gies follow the development—sometimes gradual, at other times revolutionary—of significant components in the history of the family including: The basic functions of the family as a production unit, as well as its religious, social, judicial, and educational roles. The shift of marriage from private arrangement between families to public ceremony between individuals, and the adjustments in dowry, bride-price, and counter-dowry. The development of consanguinity rules and incest taboos in church law and lay custom. The peasant family in its varying condition of being free or unfree, poor, middling, or rich. The aristocratic estate, the problem of the younger son, and the disinheritance of daughters. The Black Death and its long-term effects on the family. Sex attitudes and customs: the effects of variations in age of men and women at marriage. The changing physical environment of noble, peasant, and urban families. Arrangements by families for old age and retirement. Expertly researched, master historians Frances and Joseph Gies—whose books were used by George R.R.

As catchy as that aphorism is, it’s sadly untrue, even if it has a nice ring to it. The one thing Nero is well-known for is the one thing he actually didn’t do. But fear not, the truth of his life, his rule and what he did with unrestrained power, is plenty weird, salacious and horrifying. And he is not alone. Roman history, from the very foundation of the city, is replete with people and stories that shock our modern sensibilities. Evil Roman Emperors puts the worst of Rome’s rulers in one place and offers a review of their lives and a historical context for what made them into what they became. It concludes by ranking them, counting down to the worst ruler in Rome’s long history. Lucius Tarquinius Suburbus called peace conferences with warring states, only to slaughter foreign leaders; Commodus sold offices of the empire to the highest bidder; Caligula demanded to be worshipped as a god, and marched troops all the way to the ocean simply to collect seashells as “proof” of their conquest; even the Roman Senate itself was made up of oppressors, exploiters, and murderers of all stripes. Author Phillip Barlag profiles a host of evil Roman rulers across the history of their empire, along with the faceless governing bodies that condoned and even carried out heinous acts. Roman history, deviant or otherwise, is a subject of endless fascination. What’s never been done before is to look at the worst of the worst at the same time, comparing them side by side, and ranking them against one another. Until now.",237,History,en,9781633886919,roman emperors
Ten Caesars Roman Emperors from Augustus to Constantine,Barry Strauss,Simon & Schuster,2020-03-03,"Bestselling classical historian Barry Strauss delivers “an exceptionally accessible history of the Roman Empire…much of Ten Caesars reads like a script for Game of Thrones” (The Wall Street Journal)—a summation of three and a half centuries of the Roman Empire as seen through the lives of ten of the most important emperors, from Augustus to Constantine. In this essential and “enlightening” (The New York Times Book Review) work, Barry Strauss tells the story of the Roman Empire from rise to reinvention, from Augustus, who founded the empire, to Constantine, who made it Christian and moved the capital east to Constantinople. During these centuries Rome gained in splendor and territory, then lost both. By the fourth century, the time of Constantine, the Roman Empire had changed so dramatically in geography, ethnicity, religion, and culture that it would have been virtually unrecognizable to Augustus. Rome’s legacy remains today in so many ways, from language, law, and architecture to the seat of the Roman Catholic Church. Strauss examines this enduring heritage through the lives of the men who shaped it: Augustus, Tiberius, Nero, Vespasian, Trajan, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Diocletian, and Constantine. Over the ages, they learned to maintain the family business—the government of an empire—by adapting when necessary and always persevering no matter the cost. Ten Caesars is a “captivating narrative that breathes new life into a host of transformative figures” (Publishers Weekly). This “superb summation of four centuries of Roman history, a masterpiece of compression, confirms Barry Strauss as the foremost academic classicist writing for the general reader today” (The Wall Street Journal).",432,History,en,9781451668841,roman emperors

Bing: From Farmer's Son to Magistrate in Han China,Michael Loewe,Hackett Publishing,2011-09-15,"Much is known of life during the Han Empire, but the historical evidence remains fragmentary, and nowhere do we find a continuous account of the life of any one individual. In this engaging volume, Michael Loewe mines the written and material records to depict the imagined life of an ordinary person, Bing Wu, from the hardships of his earliest years on a rural farm to his retirement from a respected position in government service. Underlying the tale of Bing is a richly detailed portrait of life during the Han--the arduous tasks of the conscript laborer; military service on the defense lines of the north; the travels of a merchant; the grueling conditions in an iron foundry; the construction of tombs; preparations for entering the civil service; the duties of a junior clerk and the governing of a commandery. Along the way, we are introduced to the operation of a crossbow; methods of telling time; the practice of writing; the rituals of divination; the ceremony of a state occasion, laws and the harsh consequences of breaking them; the workings of the central government and much more. Included are a concise introduction, explanatory endnotes to each chapter, a selection of illustrations, a map of the Han Empire, notes for further reading and an essay by Loewe entitled, ""A Brief History of the Han Empire.""",220,History,en,9781603846639,han china

Tang China in Multi-Polar Asia A History of Diplomacy and War,Zhenping Wang,University of Hawaii Press,2013-10-31,"Using a synthetic narrative approach, this ambitious work uses the lens of multipolarity to analyze Tang China’s (618–907) relations with Turkestan; the Korean states of Koguryŏ, Silla, and Paekche; the state of Parhae in Manchuria; and the Nanzhao and Tibetan kingdoms. Without any one entity able to dominate Asia’s geopolitical landscape, the author argues that relations among these countries were quite fluid and dynamic—an interpretation that departs markedly from the prevalent view of China fixed at the center of a widespread “tribute system.” To cope with external affairs in a tumultuous world, Tang China employed a dual management system that allowed both central and local officials to conduct foreign affairs. The court authorized Tang local administrators to receive foreign visitors, forward their diplomatic letters to the capital, and manage contact with outsiders whose territories bordered on China. Not limited to handling routine matters, local officials used their knowledge of border situations to influence the court’s foreign policy. Some even took the liberty of acting without the court’s authorization when an emergency occurred, thus adding another layer to multipolarity in the region’s geopolitics. The book also sheds new light on the ideological foundation of Tang China’s foreign policy. Appropriateness, efficacy, expedience, and mutual self-interest guided the court’s actions abroad. Although officials often used “virtue” and “righteousness” in policy discussions and announcements, these terms were not abstract universal principles but justifications for the pursuit of self-interest by those involved. Detailed philological studies reveal that in the realm of international politics, “virtue” and “righteousness” were in fact viewed as pragmatic and utilitarian in nature. Comprehensive and authoritative, Tang China in Multi-Polar Asia is a major work on Tang foreign relations that will reconceptualize our understanding of the complexities of diplomacy and war in imperial China.",482,History,en,9780824837884,tang china

The Chinese government and General Secretary Zhao Ziyang in particular, encouraged and supported the project. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences commissioned over 100 of China's authorities to write for the work.

It embraces every aspect of the physical, political, economic, social, and cultural life of China, with a detailed historical background and soundly based projections for the future. Sections deal with geography and climate, natural resources, history, conservation, agriculture, economy, industry, trade and commerce, literature and the arts, and tourism. An end section, ""China in Figures"" provides a current statistical data source and an important primary resource. Topics are discussed in an historical context, followed by a detailed analysis of the current situation and by an analysis of defects and errors made to date, ending with future economic and cultural plans.

"Emperors and Usurpers in the Later Roman Empire Civil War, Panegyric, and the Construction of Legitimacy",Adrastos Omissi,Oxford University Press,2018-06-18,"One of the great maxims of history is that it is written by the victors, and nowhere does this find greater support than in the later Roman Empire. Between 284 and 395 AD, no fewer than 37 men claimed imperial power, though today we recognize barely half of these men as 'legitimate' rulers and more than two thirds died at their subjects' hands. Once established in power, a new ruler needed to publicly legitimate himself and to discredit his predecessor: overt criticism of the new regime became high treason, with historians supressing their accounts for fear of reprisals and the very names of defeated emperors chiselled from public inscriptions and deleted from official records. In a period of such chaos, how can we ever hope to record in any fair or objective way the history of the Roman state? Emperors and Usurpers in the Later Roman Empire is the first history of civil war in the later Roman Empire to be written in English and aims to address this question by focusing on the various ways in which successive imperial dynasties attempted to legitimate themselves and to counter the threat of almost perpetual internal challenge to their rule. Panegyric in particular emerges as a crucial tool for understanding the rapidly changing political world of the third and fourth centuries, providing direct evidence of how, in the wake of civil wars, emperors attempted to publish their legitimacy and to delegitimize their enemies. The ceremony and oratory surrounding imperial courts too was of great significance: used aggressively to dramatize and constantly recall the events of recent civil wars, the narratives produced by the court in this context also went on to have enormous influence on the messages and narratives found within contemporary historical texts. In its exploration of the ways in which successive imperial courts sought to communicate with their subjects, this volume offers a thoroughly original reworking of late Roman domestic politics, and demonstrates not only how history could be erased, rewritten, and repurposed, but also how civil war, and indeed usurpation, became endemic to the later Empire.",369,History,en,9780192558268,roman usurpers

Society and Culture in Late Antique Gaul Revisiting the Sources,"Ralph Mathisen, Danuta Shanzer",Taylor & Francis,2017-07-05,"Late Roman Gaul is often seen either from a classical Roman perspective as an imperial province in decay and under constant threat from barbarian invasion or settlement, or from the medieval one, as the cradle of modern France and Germany. Standard texts and ""moments"" have emerged and been canonized in the scholarship on the period, be it Gaul aflame in 407 or the much-disputed baptism of Clovis in 496/508. This volume avoids such stereotypes. It brings together state-of-the-art work in archaeology, literary, social, and religious history, philology, philosophy, epigraphy, and numismatics not only to examine under-used and new sources for the period, but also critically to reexamine a few of the old standards. This will provide a fresh view of various more unusual aspects of late Roman Gaul, and also, it is hoped, serve as a model for ways of interpreting the late Roman sources for other areas, times, and contexts.",343,History,en,9781351899215,roman usurpers
Europe's Barbarians AD 200-600,Edward James,Routledge,2014-07-22,"'Barbarians' is the name the Romans gave to those who lived beyond the frontiers of the Roman Empire - the peoples they considered 'uncivilised'. Most of the written sources concerning the barbarians come from the Romans too, and as such, need to be treated with caution. Only archaeology allows us to see beyond Roman prejudices - and yet these records are often as difficult to interpret as historical ones. Expertly guiding the reader through such historiographical complexities, Edward James traces the history of the barbarians from the height of Roman power through to AD 600, by which time they had settled in most parts of imperial territory in Europe. His book is the first to look at all Europe's barbarians: the Picts and the Scots in the far north-west; the Franks, Goths and Slavic-speaking peoples; and relative newcomers such as the Huns and Alans from the Asiatic steppes. How did whole barbarian peoples migrate across Europe? What were their relations with the Romans? And why did they convert to Christianity? Drawing on the latest scholarly research, this book rejects easy generalisations to provide a clear, nuanced and comprehensive account of the barbarians and the tumultuous period they lived through.",357,History,en,9781317868255,roman usurpers

Roman achievements in architecture, law, politics, literature, war, and philosophy serve as the foundation of modern Western society. Now, for the first time in an A-Z format, A Dictionary of the Roman Empire assembles the people, places, events, and ideas of this remarkable period in one easy-to-use source. With over 1,900 entries covering more than five hundred years of Roman history, from Julius Caesar and the Gallic Wars (59-51 B.C.) to the fall of Romulus Augustus, the last Roman emperor (476 A.D.), this accessible guide provides quick reference to one of the most studied periods of all antiquity. Every aspect of Roman life is included. Here are profiles of the great emperors, such as Marcus Aurelius, one of the most profoundly intellectual monarchs in western civilization, and the aberrant Gaius Caligula, who, after draining the Roman treasury with his eccentric behavior, made it a capital crime for citizens not to bequeath him their estates. Informative entries describe the complex workings of Roman government, such as census taking, the creation of civil service, coinage, and the venerable institution of the Senate, and offer insight into the various trends and cultural tastes that developed throughout Roman history. For example, a discussion on baths, the most common type of building in the Roman Empire, demonstrates the unique intermingling of luxury, community, recreation, and, in the provinces, an association with Rome, that served as the focus of any city aspiring to greatness. Other entries describe the practice of paganism, marriage and divorce, ludi (public games held to entertain the Roman populace), festivals of the Roman year, and gluttony (epitomized by famous gourmands such as the emperor Vitellius, who according to the historian Suetonius, lived for food, banqueting three or four times a day, routinely vomiting up his meal and starting over). Also featured are longer essays on such topics as art and architecture, gods and goddesses, and the military, as well as a chronology, a short glossary of Roman terms, and appendices listing the emperors of the Empire and diagram the often intertwined family trees of ruling dynasties.

This guide to the Late Roman Army focusses on the dramatic and crucial period that started with the accession of Diocletian and ended with the definitive fall of the Western Roman Empire. This was a turbulent period during which the Roman state and its armed forces changed. Gabriele Esposito challenges many stereotypes and misconceptions regarding the Late Roman Army; for example, he argues that the Roman military machine remained a reliable and efficient one until the very last decades of the Western Empire. The author describes the organization, structure, equipment, weapons, combat history and tactics of Late Roman military forces. The comitatenses (field armies), limitanei (frontier units), foederati (allied soldiers), bucellarii (mercenaries), scholae palatinae (mounted bodyguards), protectores (personal guards) and many other kinds of troops are covered.

The Roman Army A Social and Institutional History,Pat Southern,Oxford University Press,2007-10-01,"Written by a leading authority on Roman military history, this fascinating volume spans over a thousand years as it offers a memorable picture of one of the world's most noted fighting forces, paying special attention to the life of the common soldier. Southern here illuminates the Roman army's history, culture, and organization, providing fascinating details on topics such as military music, holidays, strategy, the construction of Roman fortresses and forts, the most common battle formations, and the many tools of war, from spears, bows and arrows, swords, and slingshots, to the large catapulta (which fired giant arrows and bolts) and the ballista (which hurled huge stones). Perhaps most interesting are the details Southern provides about everyday life in the Roman army, everything from the soldiers pay (they were paid three times per year, but money was deducted for such items as food, clothing, weapons, the burial club, the pension scheme, and so on) to their often brutal life--if whole units turned and ran, about one-tenth of the men concerned were chosen by lot and clubbed to death and the rest were put on barley rations instead of wheat. Moreover, soldiers who lost weapons or their shields would fight savagely to get them back or would die in the process, rather than suffer the shame that attached to throwing weapons away or running from the battle. Attractively illustrated, this book offers a fascinating look at the life of the Roman soldier, drawing on everything from Rome's rich historical and archaeological record to soldier's personal correspondence to depictions of military subjects in literature and art.",398,History,en,9780198044017,late roman army

Late Roman Infantryman vs Gothic Warrior AD 376–82,Murray Dahm,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-06-24,"Ravaged by civil war and pressure from the Huns to the east, in late summer AD 376 the Gothic tribe of the Theruingi – up to 200,000 people under their leader Fritigern – gathered on the northern bank of the River Danube and asked the Eastern Roman emperor, Valens, for asylum within the empire. After agreeing to convert to Arian Christianity and enrol in the Roman Army, the Goths were allowed to cross the Danube and settle in the province of Thrace. Far more people crossed the Danube than the Romans expected, however, and with winter approaching, the local Roman commander, Lupicinus, lacked the resources to feed the newcomers and did not possess sufficient troops to control them. Treated poorly and running out of food, the Goths very quickly lost faith in the Roman promises. Meanwhile, other Gothic tribes also sought permission to cross the Danube. The Greuthungi were refused permission, but soon learned that local Roman garrisons had been depleted to supervise the march of the Theruingi to the town of Marcianopolis, close to the eastern shore of the Black Sea. Taking advantage of this, the Greuthungi also entered Roman territory. Camping outside Marcianopolis, Lupicinus denied the Goths access to the town's food stores, provoking the Theruingi to begin skirmishing with the Roman troops. Fritigern convinced Lupicinus to let the Gothic leaders go and calm their people, but they did nothing to quell the warlike temper of his warriors. Lupicinus summoned troops to him, but in late 376 these Roman forces were defeated – the first of several defeats for the Romans that would culminate in the fateful battle of Adrianople in August 378, at which Roman forces led by the emperor himself confronted the Gothic host. The aftermath and repercussions of Adrianople have been much debated, but historians agree that it marks a decisive moment in the history of the Roman world. This fully illustrated book investigates the fighting men of both sides who clashed at the battles of Marcianopolis, Ad Salices and Adrianople, as the fate of the Western Roman Empire hung in the balance.",81,History,en,9781472845290,late roman army

"Military History of Late Rome, 395–425",Ilkka Syvänne,Pen and Sword Military,2021-01-18,"A detailed overview of the tumultuous events of this pivotal period, in which a divided Rome was plagued by assassination, civil wars, and invading hordes. This ambitious series offers a comprehensive narrative of late Roman military history from 284–641. Each volume gives a detailed account of the changes in organization, equipment, strategy, and tactics among both the Roman forces and their enemies in the relevant period, while also giving a detailed but accessible account of the campaigns and battles. This third volume analyzes in great detail the pivotal years of 395–425. It was then that the mighty Roman Empire faced the Great Migrations while being wracked by civil wars. In 395 the task of defending the Roman Empire fell on the great generalissimo Stilicho. He faced a series of hostile bureaucrats, emperors, usurpers, and foreign foes until he was killed in a conspiracy in 409. His death led to an event that shook up the Empire to its very core. The city of Rome fell to the Visigoths of Alaric in 410. The book shows why this happened and how and why the Germanic tribes were able to settle inside the borders of the Empire. This, however, is not the entire picture. In contrast to the West Romans, the East Romans survived the civil wars and faced the Germans, Huns, and Persia successfully. Why it was so and why were the East Romans able to take control also of West Rome in 425? The information in this book will give history buffs much to consider and debate.

The Wolf of Dalriada,Elizabeth Gates,Troubador Publishing Ltd,2016-09-16,"‘Gaelic calls spin a web through the mist in arcs of soft sound. Fear unsteadies the unseen flocks on the scrub heather hillside as men and dogs weave a trap around them in the darkling night. Once the flocks are penned, then the lanterns are turned towards the south. The watchers wait in silence.’ It is 1793... As Europe watches the French Revolution’s bloody progress, uneasy Scottish landowners struggle to secure their wealth and power. And, in Dalriada – the ancient Kingdom of Scotland – fractured truths, torn loyalties and bloody atrocities are rife. Can anyone ride the maelstrom of these dangerous times? Only, it seems, Malcolm Craig Lowrie – the legendary Wolf of Dalriada. In remote Argyll, people cry out to the young laird for protection against the evil of the Clearances. And there is also a beautiful Frenchwoman – staked as a child on the turn of a card – now living in thrall to her debauched captor, Sir William Robinson. But can the Wolf of Dalriada safeguard his people? Can the Wolf defeat enemies who, like the spirit of Argyll’s Corryvrecken Whirlpool, threaten to engulf them all? Written with a blend of mysticism and intrigue, the psychological realism of the characters is exhibited in their reaction to tremendous cultural change.

"The Celtic Tribes Origins, Ancestry & The Warrior Class",John Moss,Pen and Sword History,2025-01-31,"Explores the rise, migrations, and eventual decline of the Celtic tribes, detailing their wars, culture, and resistance against Roman expansion. The people we know as the Celts were an Iron Age culture that originated in central Europe, probably around modern-day Hungary, Southern Germany and the Czech Republic, some three thousand years ago. They were groups of distinct tribal peoples who shared a common language and culture that thrived until they were confronted by an aggressive and expansionist Roman Empire set on conquest. This book traces their many migrations westward over the following centuries, and their advances into the Atlantic coastal regions, especially into countries like France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Britain and Ireland, largely replacing the Neolithic people that formerly occupied these territories. These migrations were rarely peaceful and as a result the Celts were widely regarded as warlike and inherently aggressive. The book describes the many inter-tribal and territorial confrontations that occurred during the Roman period. It explains the fighting methods, tactics and style of Celtic warfare as well as the warrior leaders like Boudicca, Brennus, Ambiorix and Vercingetorix, and others who emerged to resist Roman incursions. Despite fierce resistance, in the end, little of that great culture survived intact. Many of these tribes were savagely and purposely exterminated as a matter of policy, others were Romanised to become reluctant citizens of the Roman Republic, and only those whose territories lay in the northern and western extremities of the Empire – in the British islands, Ireland and Brittany in North-West France, avoided total subjugation. Several hundred of these ancient Celtic and other related tribes are included here. Although each had its own distinct identity, they shared a common culture with a widespread and unifying system of religious belief largely held together by Druids. The tribes described in the book include Gauls, Germans, Galatians, Lusitanians, Britons, Picts, Cambrians and Caledonians, among many others.",282,History,en,9781399056908,gaelic tribes
"Women of Ancient Scotland Warriors, Queens, and Visionaries",Layla Gupta,Efalon Acies,,"Throughout history, the image of warriors has often been associated with men, but in the rugged and tumultuous landscape of ancient Scotland, women also played critical roles as defenders and fighters. The warriors of ancient Scotland, particularly during the era of the Picts and Celts, were not just men on horseback or in battle armor; women too took up arms, fought in battles, and led troops. The Pictish shieldmaidens stand as a testament to the warrior women of ancient Scotland, representing a rare but significant part of Scotland’s martial heritage. Pictish shieldmaidens were fierce female fighters, often depicted in ancient texts and legends as skilled in combat, wielding swords, shields, and other weapons in battle. These women were not only protectors of their lands but were also instrumental in the defence of the tribal systems that defined Pictish society. Shieldmaidens were part of a broader Celtic tradition, where women were seen as both nurturers and warriors, with the capacity to defend their families and lands when necessary. The accounts of these women, while not numerous, are potent symbols of strength and independence, painting a vivid picture of women engaged in physical combat and military strategy. The Picts, a group of tribes in what is now Scotland, were notorious for their resistance to Roman conquest. Their warrior culture extended to their women, who would fight alongside the men in the defence of their people and their traditions. Perhaps the most famous example of a Celtic woman in battle is Boudica, queen of the Iceni tribe in what is now modern-day England. Although not from Scotland itself, Boudica’s rebellion against Roman rule in the first century CE reverberated through the Celtic world, inspiring women warriors throughout the region. Boudica’s courage and leadership in battle, especially in the face of overwhelming Roman forces, highlighted the potential of women to lead military campaigns. Her example shows that women could rise to positions of immense power and influence in times of war, commanding armies and inspiring fierce loyalty from their followers.",59,History,en,,gaelic tribes

The Origins of Beowulf And the Pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia,Sam Newton,DS Brewer,1994,"A detailed and passionate argument suggesting that Beowulf originated in the pre-Viking kingdom of 8th-century East Anglia. Where did Beowulf, unique and thrilling example of an Old English epic poem come from? In whose hall did the poem's maker first tell the tale? The poem exists now in just one manuscript, but careful study of the literary and historical associations reveals striking details which lead Dr Newton to claim, as he pieces together the various clues, a specific origin for the poem. Dr Newton suggests that references in Beowulf to the heroes whose names are listed in Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies indicate that such Northern dynastic concerns are most likely to have been fostered in the kingdom of East Anglia. He supports his thesis with evidence drawn from East Anglianarchaeology, hagiography and folklore. His argument, detailed and passionate, offers the exciting possibility that he has discovered the lost origins of the poem in the pre-Viking kingdom of 8th-century East Anglia.

Race and Ethnicity in Anglo-Saxon Literature,Stephen Harris,Routledge,2004-06-01,"What makes English literature English ? This question inspires Stephen Harris's wide-ranging study of Old English literature. From Bede in the eighth century to Geoffrey of Monmouth in the twelfth, Harris explores the intersections of race and literature before the rise of imagined communities. Harris examines possible configurations of communities, illustrating dominant literary metaphors of race from Old English to its nineteenth-century critical reception. Literary voices in the England of Bede understood the limits of community primarily as racial or tribal, in keeping with the perceived divine division of peoples after their languages, and the extension of Christianity to Bede's Germanic neighbours was effected in part through metaphors of family and race. Harris demonstrates how King Alfred adapted Bede in the ninth century; how both exerted an effect on Archbishop Wulfstan in the eleventh; and how Old English poetry speaks to images of race.",371,Literary Criticism,en,9781135924362,geats

This book's intention was to correct such omissions, but discrepancy turned out to be widespread. Rather than being solely a contribution to Scandinavia's history, the material mainly illustrates aspects of English origins as viewed by one of their own kind. A post-Roman doomed culture arose in eastern England. Largely ignored in English records, the history of this is obscure, but the geography is even more so, since reliable place-names are but few. The poem predominantly served as an allegorical tool and, laced with folklore, was used to comment on the behaviour of those in leadership roles, both in politics and religion.

Vengeance in a Small Town The Thorndale Lynching of 1911,George R. Nielsen,iUniverse,2011-02-08,"One hundred years ago, in 1911, two young men lost their lives: one from a stab wound and the other by mob action. In an attempt to explain how such violence could take place in a prosperous and forward-looking community, the author first examines the growth of Thorndale as a small agricultural town on the railroad and then connects Thorndales geographical setting in central Texas with its tradition of violence. This particular lynching was unusual in that it took place at night, thereby complicating apprehension of the members of the mob. However, as a result of intervention by the governor, four men were arrested for the crime and three were tried. The lynching was also unusual because the victim was of Mexican heritage thereby inciting the Mexican community to voice its outrage and demand justice. The nature of its reaction testifies to the political awareness of the Mexican minority and also provides an insight into its perception of Anglo society.",173,History,en,9781450287975,wends

The comparative method, however, is not restricted to the consideration of sound change, and neither is the assumption of regularity. Syntactic, morphological, and semantic change are all amenable in varying degrees, to comparative reconstruction, and each type of change is constrained in ways that enable the researcher to distinguish between regular and more irregular changes. This volume draws together studies by scholars engaged in historical reconstruction, all focussing on the subject of regularity and irregularity in the comparative method.

Trubetzkoy (1890-1939) is generally celebrated today as the creator of the science of phonology. While his monumental Grundzüge der Phonologie was published posthumously and contains a summary of Trubetzkoy's late views on the linguistic function of speech sounds, there has, until now, been no practical way to trace the development of his thought or to clarify the conclusions appearing in that later work. With the publication of Studies in General Linguistics and Language Structure, not only will linguists have that opportunity, but a collection of Trubetzkoy's work will appear in English for the first time. Translated from the French, German, and Russian originals, these articles and letters present Trubetzkoy's work in general and on Indo-European linguistics. The correspondence reprinted here, also for the first time in English, is between Trubetzkoy and Roman Jakobson. The resulting collection offers a view of the evolution of Trubetzkoy's ideas on phonology, the logic in laws of linguistic geography and relative chronology, and the breadth of his involvement with Caucasian phonology and the Finno-Ugric languages. A valuable resource, this volume will make Trubetzkoy's work available to a larger audience as it sheds light on problems that remain at the center of contemporary linguistics.",348,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,0822322994,proto-slavic

"Slavs in the Making History, Linguistics, and Archaeology in Eastern Europe (ca. 500 – ca. 700)",Florin Curta,Routledge,2020-09-28,"Slavs in the Making takes a fresh look at archaeological evidence from parts of Slavic-speaking Europe north of the Lower Danube, including the present-day territories of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. Nothing is known about what the inhabitants of those remote lands called themselves during the sixth century, or whether they spoke a Slavic language. The book engages critically with the archaeological evidence from these regions, and questions its association with the ""Slavs"" that has often been taken for granted. It also deals with the linguistic evidence—primarily names of rivers and other bodies of water—that has been used to identify the primordial homeland of the Slavs, and from which their migration towards the Lower Danube is believed to have started. It is precisely in this area that sociolinguistics can offer a serious alternative to the language tree model currently favoured in linguistic paleontology. The question of how best to explain the spread of Slavic remains a controversial issue. This book attempts to provide an answer, and not just a critique of the method of linguistic paleontology upon which the theory of the Slavic migration and homeland relies. The book proposes a model of interpretation that builds upon the idea that (Common) Slavic cannot possibly be the result of Slavic migration. It addresses the question of migration in the archaeology of early medieval Eastern Europe, and makes a strong case for a more nuanced interpretation of the archaeological evidence of mobility. It will appeal to scholars and students interested in medieval history, migration, and the history of Eastern and Central Europe.",251,Foreign Language Study,en,9781351330015,proto-slavic
My Father's Fathers,Barbara Grivna,Xlibris Corporation,2013-04,"Dear Readers, My Father's Fathers is a composite of historical and archaeological fact, personal oral and written histories. These are woven together with my remembrances and hypotheses to narrate the history of my ancestors as nothing else exists to explain me. That said, combining and establishing theories is the work I put my mind to for the past three years. So please don't contact me to correct my inaccuracies or blunders. I acknowledge them and have embraced them. The scientific, historical, and archaeological information is all true as far as I can comprehend it. There really have been millions of tribes, thousands of dynasties, mass migrations, and countless wars since the Neolithic period, far too many to cite or explore deeply. I could not have written this book or found many illustrations without using the entries in Wikipedia.org. They are, in my estimation, one of the greatest boons the computer has provided us. I know people say it is not always accurate and I found different versions of events on other websites. When compared, they often offered additional information or a different view of affairs, but for my purposes they hung together. I urge you to support Wikipedia if you use their site because they always seek to upgrade their information and for this they should be rewarded. A list of all the sources I consulted containing information relevant to this paper would be virtually endless, so I have listed some of the principal authors and titles. I am greatly indebted to them all. If you wish to start exploring your genetic history, it will lead you to many exciting places. I recommend you begin your search by consulting Shannon Bennett's article in Family Tree Magazine entitled ""DNA Demystified: Genetic Genealogy for First Timers,"" p. 42, December 2012. The magazine is published by F+W Media, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio. My cat Sassy always helped me edit the information I wrote by watching the words appear on the computer screen or lying on my lap and pawing the pages as I tried to make sense of what I was trying to say.

Bogowie: A Study of Eastern Europe's Ancient Gods,T.D. Kokoszka,Simon and Schuster,2023-08-25,"T.D. Kokoszka grew up in Texas with a Jewish mother and a Polish-American father. While he was aware of roots going back to Eastern Europe from both families, he found it hard to learn very much about them. He knew that Polish people would whack one another with palm leaves around Easter, and he knew that his great-grandmother purportedly believed in forest spirits known as borowy. However, it wasn't until he was in his teens that he became vaguely aware of an ancient people known as the Slavs who gave rise to the Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Slovakian, Slovene, and Czech languages. It quickly became clear to him that this was a family of cultures currently under-represented in popular culture, and even in western scholarship. Not simply a regurgitation of scholarship from the Soviet period - and presenting new analyses by using previously neglected resources - Bogowie: A Study of Eastern Europe's Ancient Gods offers one of the most painstaking scholarly reconstructions of Slavic paganism. These new resources include not only an overview of folklore from many different Slavic countries but also comparisons with Ossetian culture and Mordvin culture, as well as a series of Slavic folktales that Kokoszka analyzes in depth, often making the case that the narratives involved are mythological and shockingly ancient. Readers will recognize many European folktale types and possibly learn to look at these folktales differently after reading this book.",444,Religion,en,9781803412863,proto-slavic

"Slavist, Linguist, Philanthropist",Jan Paul Hinrichs,Rodopi,2006,"Nicolaas van Wijk (1880-1941) was the founder of Slavic studies in the Netherlands and one of the greatest Slavists in general. This book describes for the first time how a scholar of the Dutch language, whose etymological dictionary of the Dutch language is still considered the best of its kind, was appointed in 1913 to the newly created Chair in Slavic languages at Leiden University and built up a tremendous reputation for himself in Eastern Europe. Van Wijk's relations with his famous teacher, the linguist C.C. Uhlenbeck, are followed attentively, as is his postgraduate apprenticeship in Leipzig (1902-1903), where he followed August Leskien's lectures in Slavic studies. Attention is also paid to the various aspects of Van Wijk's enormous oeuvre covering the whole field of Slavic studies and of phonology, of which he was one of the pioneers. Van Wijk did not, however, follow the lines approved for the social conduct of a Leiden professor and was at one time suspected by the police of communist activities. His commitment to materially helping all he could from an Eastern Europe torn apart by the First World War and its aftermath was exceptional. His fascination with all things Russian is a background theme that played throughout his life and even at his death: son of a Dutch Reformed minister, the bachelor Van Wijk was buried in a grave surmounted by a Russian Orthodox cross beside his Russian foster son, who died young. This book is of interest to Slavists, linguists and cultural historians.",342,Biography & Autobiography,en,9789042020238,proto-slavic
Slavs in the Middle Ages between Idea and Reality,Eduard Mühle,BRILL,2023-03-20,"The book presents a new history of the Slavs during the Middle Ages. Based on in-depth source analysis, it describes on the one hand the ‘factual’ historical structures that can be discerned behind the phenomenon of ‘the Slavs’ – from the ‘early Slavic’ population groups and their first formations of power in the 7th to 9th centuries, through the Slavic-speaking realms and nationes of the 10th to 12th centuries, to the late medieval societies of the 13th to 15th centuries. On the other hand, it analyzes external Byzantine, Latin and Arabic perceptions, as well as ‘Slavic’ self-imagery, with which the Slavs have been conceptualized or imagined as a cultural construct since the 6th century. Mühle further demonstrates that these images were already being instrumentalized for historical-political purposes in various contexts and for different purposes in the Middle Ages.",628,History,en,9789004536746,slavic settlement
The First Millennium AD in Europe and the Mediterranean An Archaeological Essay,Klavs Randsborg,CUP Archive,1991-01-25,"Modern archaeology, with its huge methodological repertoire, its interdisciplinary orientation and its rapidly expanding basis in excavations, is beginning to rewrite history, and to reshape our views of the development of Europe prior to the present millennium. Archaeological evidence draws attention to processes on which the written record is silent, or which were not fully appreciated by contemporaries in the literate centres. This book deals with the rise of medieval western Europe as the Roman Empire crumbled, and the integration of hitherto barbarian societies into the new mainstream of European society. Archaeological material is the main focus, but information derived from written sources, especially those illuminating the economic and the associated social circumstances, is also taken into account.",268,History,en,0521387876,slavic settlement

(It is also fully self-sufficient, though many readers will want to use it with its equally impressive sequel which is being published simultaneously.) In it, Professor Nicholas traces the slow regeneration of urban life in the early medieval period, showing where and how an urban tradition had survived from late antiquity, and when and why new urban communities began to form where there was no such continuity. He charts the different types and functions of the medieval city, its interdependence with the surrounding countryside, and its often fraught relations with secular authority. The book ends with the critical changes of the late thirteenth century that established an urban network that was strong enough to survive the plagues, famines and wars of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.",379,History,en,9781317885498,slavic settlement

The Archaeology of Slavery in Early Medieval Northern Europe The Invisible Commodity,"Felix Biermann, Marek Jankowiak",Springer Nature,2021-11-18,"This volume is the first comprehensive study of the material imprint of slavery in early medieval Europe. While written sources attest to the ubiquity of slavery and slave trade in early medieval British Isles, Scandinavia and Slavic lands, it is still difficult to find material traces of this reality, other than the hundreds of thousands of Islamic coins paid in exchange for the northern European slaves. This volume offers the first structured reflection on how to bridge this gap. It reviews the types of material evidence that can be associated with the institution of slavery and the slave trade in early medieval northern Europe, from individual objects (such as e.g. shackles) to more comprehensive landscape approaches. The book is divided into four sections. The first presents the analytical tools developed in Africa and prehistoric Europe to identify and describe social phenomena associated with slavery and the slave trade. The following three section review the three main cultural zones of early medieval northern Europe: the British Isles, Scandinavia, and Slavic central Europe. The contributions offer methodological reflections on the concept of the archaeology of slavery. They emphasize that the material record, by its nature, admits multiple interpretations. More broadly, this book comes at a time when the history of slavery is being integrated into academic syllabi in most western countries. The collection of studies contributes to a more nuanced perspective on this important and controversial topic. This volume appeals to multiple audiences interested in comparative and global studies of slavery, and will constitute the point of reference for future debates.",190,Social Science,en,9783030732912,slavic settlement

"Empires and Barbarians Migration, Development and the Birth of Europe",Peter Heather,Pan Macmillan,2010-12-17,"At the start of the first millennium AD, southern and western Europe formed part of the Mediterranean-based Roman Empire, the largest state western Eurasia has ever known, and was set firmly on a trajectory towards towns, writing, mosaics, and central heating. Central, northern and eastern Europe was home to subsistence farmers, living in wooden houses with mud floors, whose largest political units weighed in at no more than a few thousand people. By the year 1000, Mediterranean domination of the European landscape had been destroyed. Instead of one huge Empire facing loosely organised subsistence farmers, Europe – from the Atlantic almost to the Urals – was home to an interacting commonwealth of Christian states, many of which are still with us today .

The Archaeology of Medieval Germany An Introduction,Günter P. Fehring,Routledge,2014-10-24,"Medieval archaeology is a relatively young discipline. It relies heavily on and contributes to the neighbouring disciplines of history and geography as well as certain of the natural sciences. The kinds of sources investigated in the context of medieval archaeology also cast light on many aspects of life in later centuries. The main sources used are: graveyards, churches and churchyards; castles and fortifications; rural and urban settlements; technical production sites and routes of communication. Closely allied to these are the numerous finds of small objects of everyday life, from cutlery and tools to animal remains and grain. This book is a comprehensive discussion of what can be established from the use of such materials about the culture and daily life of medieval Germany. Each subject is augmented with the use of many illustrations. Besides methodological questions, the author considers what can be learnt about the history of settlement and architecture, of technology, of economic and social matters, of churches and missions, and of population, diet and vegetation.",166,Social Science,en,9781317605102,slavic settlement

Medieval Frontiers: Concepts and Practices,"David Abulafia, Nora Berend",Routledge,2017-03-02,"In recent years, the 'medieval frontier' has been the subject of extensive research. But the term has been understood in many different ways: political boundaries; fuzzy lines across which trade, religions and ideas cross; attitudes to other peoples and their customs. This book draws attention to the differences between the medieval and modern understanding of frontiers, questioning the traditional use of the concepts of 'frontier' and 'frontier society'. It contributes to the understanding of physical boundaries as well as metaphorical and ideological frontiers, thus providing a background to present-day issues of political and cultural delimitation. In a major introduction, David Abulafia analyses these various ambiguous meanings of the term 'frontier', in political, cultural and religious settings. The articles that follow span Europe from the Baltic to Iberia, from the Canary Islands to central Europe, Byzantium and the Crusader states. The authors ask what was perceived as a frontier during the Middle Ages? What was not seen as a frontier, despite the usage in modern scholarship? The articles focus on a number of themes to elucidate these two main questions. One is medieval ideology. This includes the analysis of medieval formulations of what frontiers should be and how rulers had a duty to defend and/or extend the frontiers; how frontiers were defined (often in a different way in rhetorical-ideological formulations than in practice); and how in certain areas frontier ideologies were created. The other main topic is the emergence of frontiers, how medieval people created frontiers to delimit areas, how they understood and described frontiers. The third theme is that of encounters, and a questioning of medieval attitudes to such encounters. To what extent did medieval observers see a frontier between themselves and other groups, and how does real interaction compare with ideological or narrative formulations of such interaction?",299,History,en,9781351918589,slavic settlement

The Origins of the Old Rus' Weights and Monetary Systems Two Studies in Western Eurasian Metrology and Numismatics in the Seventh to Eleventh Centuries,Omeljan Pritsak,Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute,1998,"This comprehensive book explores the numismatic and metrological systems of medieval Europe and the Middle East. Omeljan Pritsak shows the relationships between the numismatic systems of Western Europe, Khazaria, Volga Bulgaria, the Byzantine Empire, and Arabia and the system of Kievan Rus, and then proposes a number of innovative solutions related to the systems of Kievan Rus. Many of Pritsak's conclusions challenge conventional theories in this field. Of particular interest are the sections that concern the Khazars, Bulgars, and Varangians. There is an extensive discussion of the question of whether the Khazars minted coins, as well as an assessment of various runes and symbols.",200,Antiques & Collectibles,en,,volga bulgaria

In exchange the merchants were provided with large quantities of silver coins or dirhams, which had a powerful influence on the merchants' home areas with little or no silver of their own. The trade precipitated the Vikings' penetration into the interior of European Russia, fostered the emergence of new towns, provided the original impetus for the formation of the Rus' and Volgar Bulgar states, and helped transform the Khazar economy and state.",360,Antiques & Collectibles,en,,volga bulgaria

Knut - Varangian Novel Two in the Knut Series by Skye Smith,Skye Smith,Skye Smith,2019-04-11,"Cover Flap English children learn that Knut the Great was a pre-Norman king born of Royal Danish blood and was so conceited as to think that he could command the ocean tides. The rest of Europe learn that he was the Emperor of the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Irish Sea and the Channel. Directly or indirectly he ruled most of the peoples living around those seas and thus the trade between them flourished. Knut inherited the empire that his father, King Sweyn Forkbeard of the Danes had glued together. Glued with the technology and wealth gained from the Byzantine trade via the river routes to the Black Sea, and with Varangian warriors trained in the Byzantine. About the Author Skye Smith is my pen name. My interest in Knut stems from the endless research I did while writing “The Hoodsman” series of historical novels about the Norman invasion of England. That invasion by William the Conqueror was not a quick subjugation of a Brit-Saxon England, but a long and bitter genocide of Brit-Danish England and the destruction of Knut’s great legacy. The first novel “Knut - Jomsviking” sets the characters and scene for the entire series, so if you haven’t yet read it, now would be a good time. This is the second novel in the series where Knut’s story continues with the adventures of his father, King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark as he entwines the politics of Baltic and Black Seas with the politics of England. The chapter headings identify the dates and places. The Appendix gives historical insight and a list of characters. Enjoy.

The Varangian Guard 988–1453,Raffaele D’Amato,Osprey Publishing,2010-06-22,"The Varangian Guards were Viking mercenaries who operated far beyond their native shores as an elite force within the Byzantine Armies. Descendants from a legendary line of warriors, the Varangian Guard was formed after a group of Viking mercenaries made a major contribution to the Byzantine Emperor Basil II's victory over rebel forces in 988 AD. These 5,000 men were then retained as Basil's personal guard and would provide loyal service to many successive occupants of the imperial throne. Commonly referred to as 'foreigners' (Etaireia), they were nonetheless absorbed into a new Palatine regiment under command of an officer termed the Akolouthos, who was either a Norsemen or a Rus (Norsemen colonizers of Russia). The Varangians wore mixtures of their native clothing and armor together with a splendid formal Byzantine uniform. But most famously, they always wielded their own traditional battle-axes; this became a sign that the emperor was on the battlefield in person. This is an insightful look of one of the legendary guard units of the medieval world, complete with a dazzling array of artwork plates showing the Varangian Guard in an array of settings from court ceremonies to the battlefield.",0,History,en,1849081794,varangian

Bulgarian Geopolitics in a Balkan Context Imagining the Space of a Nation,Valentin Mihaylov,Taylor & Francis,2024-04-01,"This book is about the geographic space as an inseparable component of a nation’s historical memory, territorial awareness, geopolitical visions, and obsessions. The empirical part of the book focuses on the critical analysis of first-hand sources containing representations of the imagined spaces and places of Bulgaria and Bulgarians from a long-term perspective. The research results are structured in accordance with the author’s model of an imagined national space. It contains three general domains: possessed national space, the ethnogeopolitical neighbourhood, and ancient and legendary spaces. The book also explores how Bulgarians’ historical and ethnic spaces are linked with specific geopolitics, such as passive internal geopolitics, soft revisionism, non-intervening geopolitical claims, blocking international integration as a disguised form of old territorial claims, and emerging historical geopolitics. It examines how the imagined national space is approached by statesmen, politicians, academics, and other creators of ‘high’ geopolitics. The book also pays attention to the role of spatial imaginations in growing ‘low’ (popular) geopolitics, which includes media, popular culture, and national mythology. Written in an interdisciplinary manner, this timely book will attract the interest of scholars and students in geopolitics, human geography, international relations, nationalism studies, and ethnic history.",291,Science,en,9781040008690,old great bulgaria

This bull, summoning the ecclesiastical leaders of Western Christendom to the Fourth Lateran Council, provides an essential background to our examination of ""crusade"" during the pontificate of Pope Innocent III. It reflects the crucial foundation by which Innocent directed his efforts, and the efforts of his curia, in the years 1198-1216, whereby crusade and crusading achieved a primacy in the formulation of papal policy (unrivalled up this point in the history of the crusading movement), a primacy which was challenged only, but importantly not surpassed, by ""the reform of the universal church"".",55,History,en,9783668650268,crusades

Historical Dictionary of the Crusades,Corliss K. Slack,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2013-05-09,"The crusades were among the longest and most bitter wars in human history and consisted of no less than seven major expeditions from Western Europe from the late 11th to the early 14th centuries for the purpose of wresting Jerusalem and the Holy Land from the control of the Muslims. In the end, it was the Muslims who won, and the Christians who suffered a major setback, and the Middle East remained firmly in Muslim hands. This was one of the worst clashes between different religions and civilizations and, for long, it was largely forgotten or brushed over. That is no longer the case, with many Muslims regarding Western interference in the region as a repeat of the crusades while launching their own jihads. So, while an old conflict, it is still with us today. Even at the time, it was very hard to understand the causes and outcome of the crusades, and that remains a problem today. This Historical Dictionary of the Crusades cannot claim to have resolved it, but it most definitely does make the situation easier to understand. The introduction provides an overview, tracing the crusades from one expedition to the next, and assessing their impact. The actual flow of events is far easier to follow thanks to the chronology. And maps help to trace the events geographically. The entries, and there are more than 300 of them in this second edition, look more closely at notable figures, including Pope Gregory VII, Richard “the lionhearted,” and Saladin, as well as important places (Jerusalem, Constantinople and others), events, battles and sieges, as well as the use of weapons and armor.

Muslims on the Volga in the Viking Age In the Footsteps of Ibn Fadlan,"Jonathan Shepard, Luke Treadwell",Bloomsbury Publishing,2023-09-21,"The year 922 saw a series of remarkable face-to-face encounters in the steppes between Bukhara and the Middle Volga. Ibn Fadlan was an intrepid member of a diplomatic and religious mission from the distant caliphate in Baghdad to the ruler of the Volga Bulgars. His account gives a vivid eyewitness description of the peoples he came upon (whose appearance, rituals and filthy habits both fascinate and appal) and a famous depiction of a Viking Rus ship burial. It is unique testimony to burgeoning exchanges between several different cultures, and to the emergence of new political structures on the steppes. Yet the account survives only as part of a later composite work, raising questions of meaning and historical interpretation.

Land and Trade in Early Islam The Economy of the Islamic Middle East 750-1050 CE,"Hugh Kennedy, Fanny Bessard",Oxford University Press,2025-01-20,"Land and Trade in Early Islam discusses the latest developments in the field of early Islamic economic and social history, and explores the notion of polycentrism and the dialectic between global and local between 700 and 1050 CE. The volume explores the political mechanisms and the role of Islamic states in regulating and developing demand in the economy. The chapters question the binary of core/periphery, and demonstrate how the growing scholarship on the liminal regions of the Caliphate has transformed our understanding of the early Islamic world by offering a more nuanced picture of its regional urban and socio-economic dynamics. Changes in the peripheries of the early medieval Caliphate have traditionally been conceived as resulting from initiatives by the core. An increased focus on the comparatively under-explored regions in central Asia, north Africa, south-east Asia and the Caucasus has thrown this into question. Land and Trade in Early Islam draws on this growing body of scholarship to question the notion of peripherality, explore lines of economic influence and interdependence, and to better understand the regional economic, social and political dynamics of this period.",631,History,en,9780192608178,saqaliba

In the 13th century, Chinggis Khan rose to power, leading an empire of a million people and defeating surrounding regions with much larger populations.

This is not the story of a certain present-day state or people evolving through consecutive historical stages. Rather, the book is a modern analytical approach to the problem of human diversity as a fundamental social condition. Through cooperation and confrontation, various attempts to manage diversity fostered processes of societal self-organization, as new ideas, practices, and institutions were developed virtually from scratch or radically altered. Essentially, this is the story of individuals and societies creatively responding to their natural and social environments in unique historical circumstances. This volume explores how the mutual interactions of several local socio-political arrangements, and attempts to integrate with one of the universal cultures of the time, caused a string of unintended consequences. As a result, the enormous landmass from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east, from the Polar Circle in the north to the steppe belt in the south was divided among several regional powers. Ultimately unable to overtake each other by military force, they were locked in a zero-sum game until the uneven development of modern state institutions tilted the balance in favor of one of them – Russia.",247,History,en,9781350196827,golden horde

Focusing as it does on one of the most interesting and unusual regional examples of the Russian market transformation, successfully piloted by the republic’s long-serving President Mintimer Shaimiev, this book also argues that whilst there may be no third way between democracy and tyranny, also in economic terms, there may be and, indeed, are different forms of successful transition not necessarily foreseen or properly understood by Western observers.",236,Political Science,en,9789004213555,golden horde

The Uighur people, who lived along the northern rim of the Tarim Basin encountered foreigners from Europe, Arabia, Persia, India, China, Mongolia and Japan who traveled through their land along the Silk Road, the major trading route between Europe and China. This interaction began a rich, multicultural heritage that gave birth to these tales and continued to flourish once the sea replaced the land route for trade. The stories encapsulate Uighur history in the words of the people who migrated from the Northern Mongolian Plateau to Central Asia.

The Turkic Peoples in World History,Joo-Yup Lee,Taylor & Francis,2023-07-31,"The Turkic Peoples in World History is a thorough and rare introduction to the Turkic world and its role in world history, providing a concise history of the Turkic peoples as well as a critical discussion of their identities and origins. The ""Turks"" stepped on to the stage of history by establishing the Türk Qaghanate, the first trans-Eurasian empire in history, in 552 CE. In the following millennium, they went on to create empires that had a profound impact on world history such as the Uyghur, Khazar, and Ottoman empires. They also participated in building the Mongol empire, and these Turko-Mongol empires are credited with shaping the destinies of pre-modern China, the Middle East, and Europe. By treating the history of the Turkic peoples as a process of amalgamation and integration, rather than simply categorizing the Turkic peoples chronologically or geographically, this book offers new insights into Turkic history. This volume is a comprehensive guide for students and scholars in the fields of world history, Central Asian history, and Middle Eastern studies who are seeking to understand the historical roles of Turkic peoples and their origins.",235,History,en,9781000904222,seljuk

Warfare in Chinese History,Hans van de Ven,BRILL,2021-07-26,"Our understanding of Chinese warfare has suffered from misconstrued contrasts between Chinese and Western ways in warfare. This is one of the arguments convincingly set forth in this important volume on an important subject. It also discusses the essentialising interpretations of Chinese culture focussing on the avoidance of warfare and the civil ethic of its officials. Based on original sources, and dealing with the subject from the earliest dynasty up to modernity, it uniquely combines chapters on strategy and tactics. Both scope and approach make it a must for historians of China. And, with a view to its conclusions on the place of China in the context of global military history, it also provides essential reading for historians of (comparative) warfare in general. The book’s primary goal – to provide a fuller interpretation of the role of the military in Chinese history – has been achieved with ease.",464,History,en,9789004482944,great liao
"Time, Temporality, and Imperial Transition East Asia from Ming to Qing",Lynn A. Struve,University of Hawaii Press,2005-01-31,"Time is basic to human consciousness and action, yet paradoxically historians rarely ask how it is understood, manipulated, recorded, or lived. Cataclysmic events in particular disrupt and realign the dynamics of temporality among people. For historians, the temporal effects of such events on large polities such as empires—the power projections of which always involve the dictation of time—are especially significant. This important and intriguing volume is an investigation of precisely such temporal effects, focusing on the northern and eastern regions of the Asian subcontinent in the seventeenth century, when the polity at the core of East Asian civilization, Ming dynasty China, collapsed and was replaced by the Manchu-ruled Qing dynasty.

Among the far-reaching case studies are Barbara Mundy’s cartographic history of Indigenous dispossession in the Americas, Peter Bol’s examination of two Chinese maps created five hundred years apart, and Ali Yaycıoğlu’s exploration of tensions between top-down and bottom-up mapping of Habsburg and Ottoman border claims.",298,Technology & Engineering,en,9780226839011,great liao
"China Among Equals The Middle Kingdom and Its Neighbors, 10th-14th Centuries",Morris Rossabi,Univ of California Press,2023-11-15,"Scholars have long accepted China's own view of its traditional foreign relations: that China devised its own world order and maintained it from the second century B.C. to the nineteenth century. China ruled out equality with any nation: foreign rulers and their envoys were treated as subordinates or inferiors, required to send periodic tribute embassies to the Chinese emperor. The Chinese court was otherwise uninterested in foreign lands. Its principal interests were to maintain peace with what it perceived to be barbarian neighbors and to coax or coerce them into admitting China's superiority and accepting the Chinese emperor as the Son of Heaven. But Chinese foreign policy was not monolithic. Court officials in traditional times were much more realistic and pragmatic than is commonly assumed. They did not scorn foreign trade, nor were ignorant of foreign lands. Challenging the accepted view of Chinese foreign relations, the authors of China among Equals contribute to a clearer assessment of Chinese foreign relations and policy. From the tenth to the thirteenth centuries, China did not dogmatically enforce its own world order. Chinese were eager for foreign trade and knowledgeable about their neighbors. The Sung (960-1279), the principal dynasty during that era, was flexible in its dealings with foreigners. Its officials recognized the military and political weakness of the dynasty, and in general they adopted a realistic and pragmatic foreign policy. They were compelled to accept foreign states as equals, and the relations between China and other states were defined by diplomatic parity. Scholars have long accepted China's own view of its traditional foreign relations: that China devised its own world order and maintained it from the second century B.C. to the nineteenth century.

Nomads as Agents of Cultural Change The Mongols and Their Eurasian Predecessors,"Reuven Amitai, Michal Biran",University of Hawaii Press,2014-12-31,"Since the first millennium BCE, nomads of the Eurasian steppe have played a key role in world history and the development of adjacent sedentary regions, especially China, India, the Middle East, and Eastern and Central Europe. Although their more settled neighbors often saw them as an ongoing threat and imminent danger—“barbarians,” in fact—their impact on sedentary cultures was far more complex than the raiding, pillaging, and devastation with which they have long been associated in the popular imagination. The nomads were also facilitators and catalysts of social, demographic, economic, and cultural change, and nomadic culture had a significant influence on that of sedentary Eurasian civilizations, especially in cases when the nomads conquered and ruled over them. Not simply passive conveyors of ideas, beliefs, technologies, and physical artifacts, nomads were frequently active contributors to the process of cultural exchange and change. Their active choices and initiatives helped set the cultural and intellectual agenda of the lands they ruled and beyond. This volume brings together a distinguished group of scholars from different disciplines and cultural specializations to explore how nomads played the role of “agents of cultural change.” The beginning chapters examine this phenomenon in both east and west Asia in ancient and early medieval times, while the bulk of the book is devoted to the far flung Mongol empire of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. This comparative approach, encompassing both a lengthy time span and a vast region, enables a clearer understanding of the key role that Eurasian pastoral nomads played in the history of the Old World. It conveys a sense of the complex and engaging cultural dynamic that existed between nomads and their agricultural and urban neighbors, and highlights the non-military impact of nomadic culture on Eurasian history. Nomads as Agents of Cultural Change illuminates and complicates nomadic roles as active promoters of cultural exchange within a vast and varied region. It makes available important original scholarship on the new turn in the study of the Mongol empire and on relations between the nomadic and sedentary worlds.",362,History,en,9780824847890,great liao

The Turkish Dialects of Trabzon: Analysis,Bernt Brendemoen,Otto Harrassowitz Verlag,2002,"The dialects spoken in Trabzon on the Eastern Black Sea Coast are the Anatolian dialects that have preserved the most archaic features. At the same time, they are the ones that display the greatest number of innovations, due to the influence of other languages in the region. The archaisms indicate that the first speakers of Turkish must have settled in the area more than a hundred years before the Ottoman conquest, i.e. in the 14th century, although historical sources give no information on Turkish settlements at that time.The main aim of this study is to analyze the Trabzon dialects synchronically and diachronically and to explain the features that distinguish them from other Anatolian dialects. The study also makes a hypothesis about the turkization of the area. The second volume contains dialect texts which constitute the material for the analyses in the first volume.

The Mongol World,"Timothy May, Michael Hope",Taylor & Francis,2022-05-25,"Drawing upon research carried out in several different languages and across a variety of disciplines, The Mongol World documents how Mongol rule shaped the trajectory of Eurasian history from Central Europe to the Korean Peninsula, from the thirteenth century to the fifteenth century.

Issues pertaining to the Mongols and their role within the societies that they conquered therefore take precedence over the historical narrative of the societies that they conquered. Alongside the formation, conquests, administration, and political structure of the Mongol Empire, the second section examines archaeology and art history, family and royal households, science and exploration, and religion, which provides greater insight into the social history of the Empire -- an aspect often neglected by traditional dynastic and political histories.

Atlas of the Medieval World,Rosamond McKitterick,,2004,"Forged in an age of faith and war and tempered by great statesmen, religious leaders and artists, medieval civilizations witnessed remarkable transformations. Far from being a homogeneous world of knights and castles, the era saw a multitude of contrasting and often competing cultures, many of which became the foundation stones for the emergence of modern societies. From the expansion of Islam across the Mediterranean to the appearance of centralized states and Christian monarchies, the Atlas of the Medieval World draws from new archival and archaeological evidence to reveal a period of astonishing cultural vibrancy and political diversity. Alongside stunning maps covering nearly a millennium of one of the most formative phases in history, hundreds of exquisite pictures of art and architecture accompany expertly written text edited by Rosamond McKitterick, Professor of Early Medieval History at Cambridge University to bring an extraordinary period to life as no reference has before. The Arab invasions of Europe, the empire of Charlemagne, the African kingdoms of Songhai and Mali, the Crusades, the Viking and Mongol invasions, the Delhi sultanate and the T'ang and Ming empires are just a few of the subjects explained in the Atlas of the Medieval World. What's more, cultural and economic trends such as the spread of literacy and the growth of towns receive equal attention alongside the emergence of kingdoms and the march of armies to form a comprehensive history of all major societies outside of the Americas during the Middle Ages.",312,History,en,,qangli
"Operation Don's Left Wing The Trans-Caucasus Front's Pursuit of the First Panzer Army, November 1942–February 1943",David M. Glantz,University Press of Kansas,2019-12-13,"On 1 January 1943, with German Sixth Army about to be destroyed in the Stalingrad pocket, the Stavka (Soviet High Command) launched Operation Don, a strategic offensive conducted by the Red Army’s Southern, Southwestern, and Trans-Caucasus Fronts aimed at demolishing German defenses in the southern Soviet Union and decisively turning the war’s tide. Critical to this ambitious operation was the mission assigned to the Trans-Caucasus Front—to isolate and destroy German Army Group A in the northern Caucasus region in cooperation with the Southern Front. Operation Don’s Left Wing is the first detailed study of this crucial but virtually overlooked Soviet military operation. Because of the priority given to the assault on German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, the Red Army Southwestern, Southern, and Trans-Caucasus Fronts were compelled to execute their missions with scant resources—inadequate logistical support, personnel replacements, and reinforcing equipment. Based on newly released Red Army archival operational documents, David M. Glantz constructs a clear, comprehensive account of how, despite such constraints, the Trans-Caucasus Front nonetheless pursued and severely damaged German First Panzer Army—although it failed to encircle and destroy the panzer army as hoped. These documents include candid daily orders and reports, periodic situation maps, a full array of ever-changing operational plans, and strength and casualty reports prepared by Soviet formations and units throughout the offensive. With unprecedented access to these documents, Glantz delves into previously forbidden topics such as unit strengths and losses and the foibles and attitudes of commanders at every level. Following Glantz’s Operation Don’s Main Attack, this documentary study expands our understanding of a pivotal operation in the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany and a decisive moment in the history of World War II on the Eastern Front.",864,History,en,9780700628438,kangly
Star Wars: Master of Evil,Adam Christopher,Random House,2025-11-11,"After Revenge of the Sith, a newly forged Darth Vader hunts for the secrets of life and death under the watchful eye of Emperor Palpatine. In the wake of Emperor Palpatine’s rise to power, the true nature of his most sinister enforcer remains a mystery. Darth Vader is a dominant yet illusive figure: the shadow cast by a malignant Imperial regime, unknowable to even its top officials. But even as his humanity gives way to myth, Vader remains haunted by the promises of the dark side, seeking the ultimate power that his master has hinted at but withheld—the power to conquer death itself. On the volcanic world of Mustafar, Vader undertakes a dark ritual, bleeding a kyber crystal to forge his lightsaber. This act unleashes a power far greater than he anticipated, giving him a glimpse into the limitless potential of the Force. Vader is determined to follow this vision, even if it means defying his master’s orders. Yet he finds the Emperor is suspiciously supportive of his mission, even sending Vader to the Diso system to investigate rumors of a Force-wielding shaman able to raise the dead. At his side are a cadre of the Emperor’s scarlet-robed Royal Guard, led by Colonel Halland Goth—a decorated soldier with a very personal interest in Vader’s mission. Even as the Emperor’s true motivations reveals themselves, Vader falls deeper into obsession. His journey takes him far across the galaxy, chasing rumors and phantoms. But no matter how far he travels, he cannot escape the shadows within his own soul. Haunted by the echoes of his past, Vader circles the true resolution to his quest: only once all weakness is purged can he become a master of evil.",377,Fiction,en,9781804957912,kangly

"At the Gate of Christendom Jews, Muslims and 'Pagans' in Medieval Hungary, C.1000 - C.1300",Nora Berend,Cambridge University Press,2001-05-17,"Modern life in increasingly heterogeneous societies has directed attention to patterns of interaction, often using a framework of persecution and tolerance. This study of the economic, social, legal and religious position of three minorities (Jews, Muslims and pagan Turkic nomads) argues that different degrees of exclusion and integration characterized medieval non-Christian status in the medieval Christian kingdom of Hungary between 1000 and 1300. A complex explanation of non-Christian status emerges from the analysis of their economic, social, legal and religious positions and roles. Existence on the frontier with the nomadic world led to the formulation of a frontier ideology, and to anxiety about Hungary's detachment from Christendom, which affected policies towards non-Christians. The study also succeeds in integrating central European history with the study of the medieval world, while challenging such current concepts in medieval studies as frontier societies, persecution and tolerance, ethnicity and 'the other'.",363,History,en,9780521651851,cuman

The Romanians and the Turkic Nomads North of the Danube Delta from the Tenth to the Mid-Thirteenth Century,Victor Spinei,BRILL,2009,"The author of the present volume aims to investigate the relationships between Romanians and nomadic Turkic groups (Pechenegs, Uzes, Cumans) in the southern half of Moldavia, north of the Danube Delta, between the tenth century and the great Mongol invasion of 1241-1242. The Carpathian-Danubian area particularly favoured the development of sedentary life, throughout the millennia, but, at various times, nomadic pastoralists of the steppes also found this area favourable to their own way of life. Due to the basic features of its landscape, the above-mentioned area, which includes a vast plain, became the main political stage of the Romanian ethnic space, a stage on which local communities had to cope with the pressures of successive intrusions of nomadic Turks, attracted by the rich pastures north of the Lower Danube. Contacts of the Romanians and of the Turkic nomads with Byzantium, Kievan Rus, Bulgaria and Hungary are also investigated. The conclusions of the volume are based on an analysis of both written sources (narrative, diplomatic, cartographic) and archaeological finds.",565,History,en,9789004175365,cuman

"Armies of the Steppe Nomads, 376–1227 from the Coming of Attila's Huns to the Death of Genghis, Great Khan of the Mongols",Gabriele Esposito,Pen and Sword Military,2024-12-30,"Gabriele Esposito presents an overview of the history, organization and equipment of the military forces deployed by the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes during the period from the appearance of the Huns in Eastern Europe to the death of Genghis Khan. Each chapter is devoted to a different group that played a prominent military role during Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Starting with the Huns of Attila, whose migration was one of the key factors behind the fall of the Roman Empire, he moves on to the Avars, who established a large state in Eastern Europe that contested with Charlemagne’s Frankish Empire. Chapter three covers the Magyars, who terrorized most of Europe during the tenth century before creating the Kingdom of Hungary. Next are the Bulgars, who became the worst enemies of the Byzantine Empire in the Balkans but also created a flourishing state in the Volga region of Russia. The Khazars and the Alans share a chapter, as do the Pechenegs and Cumans-Kipchaks, while the Turks merit a dedicated chapter. Last but not least are the Mongols, who are traced from the unification of their tribes to the death of the great Genghis Khan. By describing the military organization, weapons and tactics of these nomadic peoples the author shows how they dominated the battlefields of the world for almost 1,000 years thanks to their superior capabilities. He also discusses how they interacted with other civilizations and how the latter learned a lot from them, especially militarily. Without the existence of the warlike nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes, the history of the world would have been very different.",375,History,en,9781399037792,cuman

With this work, István Vásáry presents an extensive examination of their history from 1185 to 1365. The basic instrument of Cuman and Tatar political success was their military force, over which none of the Balkan warring factions could claim victory. As a consequence, groups of the Cumans and the Tatars settled and mingled with the local population in various regions of the Balkans. The Cumans were the founders of three successive Bulgarian dynasties (Asenids, Terterids and Shishmanids) and the Wallachian dynasty (Basarabids). They also played an active role in Byzantium, Hungary and Serbia, with Cuman immigrants being integrated into each country's elite.

""Shamans - holy men and healers among the pagan faiths - relied heavily on animal sacrifices to create spiritual purity and to nourish the soul and, as a result, animals and spirituality were locked in a mutually dependent embrace.

Military Diasporas Building of Empire in the Middle East and Europe (550 BCE-1500 CE),"Georg Christ, Patrick Sänger, Mike Carr",Taylor & Francis,2022-11-30,"Military Diasporas proposes a new research approach to analyse the role of foreign military personnel as composite and partly imagined para-ethnic groups. These groups not only buttressed a state or empire’s military might but crucially connected, policed, and administered (parts of) realms as a transcultural and transimperial class while representing the polity’s universal or at least cosmopolitan aspirations at court or on diplomatic and military missions. Case studies of foreign militaries with a focus on their diasporic elements include the Achaemenid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Roman Empire in the ancient world. These are followed by chapters on the Sassanid and Islamic occupation of Egypt, Byzantium, the Latin Aegean (Catalan Company) to Iberian Christian noblemen serving North African Islamic rulers, Mamluks and Italian Stradiots, followed by chapters on military diasporas in Hungary, the Teutonic Order including the Sword Brethren, and the Swiss military. The volume thus covers a broad band of military diasporic experiences and highlights aspects of their role in the building of state and empire from Antiquity to the late Middle Ages and from Persia via Egypt to the Baltic.

Pechenegs Turkic Nomads and Their Impact on Eastern Europe & the Middle Ages,Rolf Hedger,,,"The Pechenegs were one of the most dynamic yet often overlooked forces that shaped the medieval history of Eastern Europe. Originating from the vast expanses of Central Asia, these Turkic nomads forged a distinct identity on the Eurasian steppe, emerging as a formidable power between the 9th and 12th centuries. Known for their mobility, resilience, and military prowess, the Pechenegs became both feared adversaries and valuable allies to some of the most powerful states of their time, including the Byzantine Empire and Kievan Rus'. Their history offers a window into the volatile world of the medieval steppes, where alliances shifted rapidly and survival depended on adaptation, strength, and strategic cunning. The Pechenegs did not exist in isolation. Their movements were deeply influenced by the broader dynamics of the steppe, particularly the pressures from rising powers like the Khazars, the Magyars, and later the Cumans. As pastoral nomads, their culture was intricately tied to the rhythms of the land, emphasizing mobility, clan loyalty, and martial skill. Their interactions with sedentary civilizations created a vibrant, often violent frontier where trade, diplomacy, and warfare were deeply intertwined. Yet despite their profound impact, the Pechenegs remain shrouded in mystery due to the fragmentary and often biased nature of the historical records. Much of what we know comes from external sources—Byzantine chroniclers, Rus' annals, and Islamic geographers—who viewed the Pechenegs through the lens of their own cultural and political agendas. This book seeks to reconstruct the world of the Pechenegs and explore their role in the transformation of medieval Eastern Europe. By examining their origins, society, and interactions with major powers, we can better understand the complex networks of influence that shaped the medieval world. Moreover, studying the Pechenegs challenges modern assumptions about the so-called ""barbarian"" nomads, revealing a people whose contributions to history were both subtle and profound. Their story reminds us that the history of Europe was not solely written by empires and kingdoms but also by the restless, resilient peoples who moved across its open frontiers.",65,History,en,,pechenegs

Since 1991 it has been independent and has had to forge its own policy in all fields. Kazakhstan is in an enviable position in terms of exportable natural resources, but at the same time it is faced with many domestic problems, such as an inadequate infrastructure. Along with solving a multitude of social problems, Kazakhstan has had to simultaneously create a normal functioning state, which added to its political difficulties. The situation at present is a state run by a strong ruler, which solves some problems but creates others. The Historical Dictionary of Kazakhstan covers the history of Kazakhstan through a chronology, an introductory essay, appendixes, and a bibliography. The dictionary section has over 400 cross-referenced entries on important personalities, politics, economy, foreign relations, religion, and culture. This book is an excellent access point for students, researchers, and anyone wanting to know more about Kazakhstan.",363,History,en,9798216239291,karluks

The Ameer Abdur Rahman,Stephen Wheeler,,1895,"This book is a biography, published in London in 1895, of ʻAbd al-Rahman Khan (circa 1844-1901), amir of Afghanistan from 1880 to 1901. ʻAbd al-Rahman Khan was a grandson of Dost Mohammad Khan, the founder the Barakzai dynasty of Afghanistan after the fall of the Durranis in 1842. ʻAbd al-Rahman was driven into exile in 1869, when his father and uncle lost a long struggle with Sher ʻAli to succeed Dost Mohammad. ʻAbd al-Rahman lived in Samarkand (in present-day Uzbekistan) in what was then Russian Turkestan until 1880, when, amid the Second Anglo-Afghan War of 1878-80, he returned to Kabul, where he was installed as amir. He negotiated a settlement with the British, whereby the British recognized him as amir while he acknowledged the British right to control the foreign relations of Afghanistan. The book recounts these events, as well as ʻAbd al-Rahman's subsequent rule and his consolidation and partial modernization of the country up to 1895. The concluding chapter, entitled ""A Ruler in Islam,"" describes the amir's accomplishments as an administrator in reforming and strengthening the Afghan state and its institutions, including the army. An appendix contains excerpts from the amir's autobiography, translated from a Russian text produced during his exile in Russian Turkestan. The book includes a genealogical table of the Barakzais, a chronology, illustrations, and two maps. The author, Stephen Wheeler, was the editor of Civil and Military Gazette (CMG), a daily newspaper that was published in Lahore (in present-day Pakistan), which circulated in the Punjab, at that time part of British India. Wheeler wrote or edited several other books, but he is best known as the editor who employed the young Rudyard Kipling in his first job in journalism.",296,Afghan Wars,en,,hazaras
"The Lovers Afghanistan's Romeo and Juliet, the True Story of How They Defied Their Families and Escaped an Honor Killing",Rod Nordland,HarperCollins,2016-01-26,"A riveting, real-life equivalent of The Kite Runner—an astonishingly powerful and profoundly moving story of a young couple willing to risk everything for love that puts a human face on the ongoing debate about women’s rights in the Muslim world. Zakia and Ali were from different tribes, but they grew up on neighboring farms in the hinterlands of Afghanistan. By the time they were young teenagers, Zakia, strikingly beautiful and fiercely opinionated, and Ali, shy and tender, had fallen in love. Defying their families, sectarian differences, cultural conventions, and Afghan civil and Islamic law, they ran away together only to live under constant threat from Zakia’s large and vengeful family, who have vowed to kill her to restore the family’s honor. They are still in hiding. Despite a decade of American good intentions, women in Afghanistan are still subjected to some of the worst human rights violations in the world. Rod Nordland, then the Kabul bureau chief of the New York Times, had watched these abuses unfold for years when he came upon Zakia and Ali, and has not only chronicled their plight, but has also shepherded them from danger. The Lovers will do for women’s rights generally what Malala’s story did for women’s education. It is an astonishing story about self-determination and the meaning of love that illustrates, as no policy book could, the limits of Western influence on fundamentalist Islamic culture and, at the same time, the need for change.",313,Biography & Autobiography,en,9780062378842,hazaras

"Negotiating nation and female individualism between East and West. Aspects of Afghan society and their representation in Nadia Hashimi's ""When the Moon is Low"" (2015)",Matthias Dickert,GRIN Verlag,2023-01-20,"Essay from the year 2023 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, University of Marburg (Marburg Centre for Canadian Studies), language: English, abstract: The manifold reflections of loss of home or migration are complex in the displacement histories and narratives because they contain difficult, untraceable journeys and experiences of immigrants and refugees involved. At present, this also concerns the largest religious community linked to massive migration movements worldwide – the Muslims. All Muslim immigrants coming to Europe, Canada or the United States carry their national, cultural, religious and above all their personal past which taken together create an ideal basis for narrating their stories. Things are worse in their own way when people at present are trying to flee from Afghanistan since the Taliban came back to power in 2021. Most Afghan people trying to escape from their mothercountry carry classical colonial or postcolonial topics such as matters of loss, expulsion, displacement, border crossing, exile, diaspora and home. These are – as in the case with female characters – often linked to intolerance, gender injustice or the inferior role of women in the Muslim world, which at present can be seen in Iran as well. Nadia Hashemi’s novel “When the Moon is Low” (2015) is set against this background and offers an impressive story of an Afghan family's escape from the Taliban governed Afghanistan through the eyes of the main character Fereiba Waziri. Fereiba is a bold Afghani woman who decides to leave her homecountry after her husband's assassination by Talibani radicals. Crossing transational boundaries, the novel is a description of the plight of contemporary migrants who are set between the crisis of displacement and emplacement, all told from a female perspective.",32,Literary Criticism,en,9783346797377,hazaras

Sex in the Land of Genghis Khan From the Times of the Great Conqueror to Today,Baasanjav Terbish,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,2023-04-11,"This book examines the history of sexuality in Mongolia over the last 800 years. As a culture-specific and time-specific system of values, practices and identities, sexuality in Mongolia, as elsewhere, has been subject to change as Mongolian society transformed from an empire to a post-imperial regional power to a Qing colony to a socialist country, before embracing liberal democracy in the 1990s. Since every social change tends to become reflected in sexuality, this study takes into account a range of intertwined topics, including religious ideologies, political ideologies, law, gender and relationships between individuals and the state, all of which have evolved throughout Mongolia’s history and require rethinking if one is to describe such a complex social phenomenon as human sexuality.",185,Social Science,en,9781666937503,turco-mongol

After Ulrich Haarmann's fundamental theses, research on this group seems to have paused, in comparison to the study dedicated to other social groups of Mamluk society. This volume brings together the results of an international conference and presents the state of the art in approaching the Mamluk descendants, whose emic perception as a group and social roles were far more differentiated and variable than previously assumed.

Persianate Selves Memories of Place and Origin Before Nationalism,Mana Kia,Stanford University Press,2020-05-19,"For centuries, Persian was the language of power and learning across Central, South, and West Asia, and Persians received a particular basic education through which they understood and engaged with the world. Not everyone who lived in the land of Iran was Persian, and Persians lived in many other lands as well. Thus to be Persian was to be embedded in a set of connections with people we today consider members of different groups. Persianate selfhood encompassed a broader range of possibilities than contemporary nationalist claims to place and origin allow. We cannot grasp these older connections without historicizing our conceptions of difference and affiliation. Mana Kia sketches the contours of a larger Persianate world, historicizing place, origin, and selfhood through its tradition of proper form: adab. In this shared culture, proximities and similarities constituted a logic that distinguished between people while simultaneously accommodating plurality. Adab was the basis of cohesion for self and community over the turbulent eighteenth century, as populations dispersed and centers of power shifted, disrupting the circulations that linked Persianate regions. Challenging the bases of protonationalist community, Persianate Selves seeks to make sense of an earlier transregional Persianate culture outside the anachronistic shadow of nationalisms.",386,History,en,9781503611962,turco-mongol

Constructing Ottoman Beneficence An Imperial Soup Kitchen in Jerusalem,Amy Singer,State University of New York Press,2012-02-01,"Ottoman charitable endowments (waqf) constituted an enduring monument to imperial beneficence and were important instruments of policy. One type of endowment, the public soup kitchen (imaret) served travelers, scholars, pious mystics, and local indigents alike. Constructing Ottoman Beneficence examines the political, social, and cultural context for founding these public kitchens. It challenges long-held notions about the nature of endowments and explores for the first time how Ottoman modes of beneficence provide an important paradigm for understanding universal questions about the nature of charitable giving. A typical and well-documented example was the imaret of Hasseki Hurrem Sultan, wife of Sultan Süleyman I, in Jerusalem. The imaret operated at the confluence of imperial endowment practices and Ottoman food supply policies, while also exemplifying the role of imperial women as benefactors. Through its operations, the imaret linked imperial Ottoman and local Palestinian interests, integrating urban and rural economies.",257,Social Science,en,9780791488768,turco-mongol
Babur The Chessboard King,Aabhas Maldahiyar,Penguin Random House India Private Limited,2024-02-19,"Babur, the visionary founder of Timurid Empire in Hindustan, had a fair share of early struggle following his father’s tragic demise in AD 1494. Then on, Babur embarked on an unyielding pursuit of power amid treacherous political landscapes, the narrative unveils his moniker, ‘the chessboard king,’ portraying his adept navigation through political intricacies and adversities. From his ascent to rulership in Ferghana amidst familial threats to fleeting victories and losses in Samarkand, the book paints a poignant picture of Babur's journey. It portrays his retreat to tribal lands after relinquishing hopes of reclaiming Ferghana, eventually establishing a mountainous kingdom in Kabul, a pivotal milestone preceding his ambition to expand into Hindustan. Recounting his initial endeavour to penetrate Hindustan in AD 1505, his alliances, and subsequent setbacks after Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah's demise, leaving him as the sole Timurid prince in power, the book opens a window to Babur's failed second attempt to enter Hindustan, encapsulating the initial thirteen to fourteen tumultuous years of his reign, marked by exile, fleeting victories, and delicate alliances. Gripping, anecdotal and deeply researched Babur: The Chessboard King delves into Hindustan's economic landscape during Timurid rule and portrays Babur as a multifaceted ruler, challenging the typical depiction of an infallible conqueror and a good human being. Meticulously sourced from the Persian manuscript of the Baburnama and other primary sources, this book represents a milestone in Babur's biographical genre, essential for comprehending the ambitions of this enigmatic king.",501,History,en,9789357088770,turco-mongol

The internal growth of the European economies and the influx of silver from the New World gave Atlantic Europe an increasingly important position in world trade and caused a major shift in inland Asian trade.

The Timurids travelled south: establishing themselves as the new rulers of a region roughly comprising modern Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern India, and founding what would become the Mughal Empire (1526-1857). The last survivors of the House of Timur, the Mughals drew invaluable political capital from their lineage, which was recognized for its charismatic genealogy and court culture - the features of which are examined here. By identifying Mughal loyalty to Turco-Mongol institutions and traditions, Lisa Balabanlilar here positions the Mughal dynasty at the centre of the early modern Islamic world as the direct successors of a powerful political and religious tradition.",256,History,en,9780857732460,turco-mongol

This volume shows how the writing of history achieved these effects by examining the implicit messages conveyed by the texts and illustrations of key manuscripts. It answers such questions as how the Ottomans understood themselves within their court and in relation to non-Ottoman others; how they visualized the ideal ruler; how they defined their culture and place in the world; and what the significance of Islam was in their self-definition.,201,History,en,9780253008749,turco-mongol

The ensuing Mongol-Armenian relations were varied. The Greater Armenians became subjects of the Mongol Empire, whereas the Cilician Armenians, by entering into vassalage, became allies and furthered the Mongol conquests. In order to enhance our understanding of this turning point in medieval history, the effects of long distance military raids, missions, diplomacy, collaboration, administrative assistance and confrontation as well as the reasons for invading Greater Armenia and motives for establishing an alliance, are considered.",288,History,en,9789004192119,turco-mongol
A Short History of the Mongols,George Lane,Bloomsbury Publishing,2018-01-25,"The Mongol Empire was the mightiest land empire the world has ever seen. At its height it was twice the size of its Roman equivalent. For a remarkable century and a half it commanded a population of 100 million people, while the rule of Chinggis (Genghis) Khan marched undefeated from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea. George Lane argues that the Mongols were not only subjugators who swept all before them but one of the great organising forces of world history. His book traces the rise of the Great Khan in 1206 to the dissolution of the empire in 1368 by the Ming Dynasty. He discusses the unification of the Turko-Mongol tribes under Chinggis' leadership; the establishment of a vigorous imperium whose Pax Mongolica held mastery over the Central Asian steppes; imaginative policies of religious pluralism; and the rich legacy of the Toluid Empire of Yuan China and Ilkhanate Iran. Offering a bold and sympathetic understanding of Mongol history, the author shows that commercial expansion, cultural assimilation and dynamic political growth were as crucial to Mongol success as desire for conquest.",257,History,en,9781786733399,turco-mongol
The Imperial Harem Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire,Leslie P. Peirce,"Oxford University Press, USA",1993,"The unprecedented political power of the Ottoman imperial harem in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is widely viewed as illegitimate and corrupting. This book examines the sources of royal women's power and assesses the reactions of contemporaries, which ranged from loyal devotion to armed opposition. By examining political action in the context of household networks, Leslie Peirce demonstrates that female power was a logical, indeed an intended, consequence of political structures. Royal women were custodians of sovereign power, training their sons in its use and exercising it directly as regents when necessary. Furthermore, they played central roles in the public culture of sovereignty--royal ceremonial, monumental building, and patronage of artistic production. The Imperial Harem argues that the exercise of political power was tied to definitions of sexuality. Within the dynasty, the hierarchy of female power, like the hierarchy of male power, reflected the broader society's control for social control of the sexually active.",404,History,en,0195086775,turco-mongol
Afghanistan A History from 1260 to the Present,Jonathan L. Lee,Reaktion Books,2022-03-08,"A colossal history of Afghanistan from its earliest organization into a coherent state up to its turbulent present. Located at the intersection of Asia and the Middle East, Afghanistan has been strategically important for thousands of years. Its ancient routes and strategic position between India, Inner Asia, China, Persia, and beyond has meant the region has been subject to frequent invasions, both peaceful and military. As a result, modern Afghanistan is a culturally and ethnically diverse country, but one divided by conflict, political instability, and by mass displacements of its people. In this magisterial illustrated history, Jonathan L. Lee tells the story of how a small tribal confederacy in a politically and culturally significant but volatile region became a modern nation-state. Drawing on more than forty years of study, Lee places the current conflict in Afghanistan in its historical context and challenges many of the West’s preconceived ideas about the country. Focusing particularly on the powerful Durrani monarchy, which united the country in 1747 and ruled for nearly two and a half centuries, Lee chronicles the origins of the dynasty as clients of Safavid Persia and Mughal India: the reign of each ruler and their efforts to balance tribal, ethnic, regional, and religious factions; the struggle for social and constitutional reform; and the rise of Islamic and Communist factions. Along the way, he offers new cultural and political insights from Persian histories, the memoirs of Afghan government officials, British government and India Office archives, and recently released CIA reports and Wikileaks documents. He also sheds new light on the country’s foreign relations, its internal power struggles, and the impact of foreign military interventions such as the “War on Terror.”",797,History,en,9781789140194,turco-mongol

Timurids in Transition Turko-Persian Politics and Acculturation in Medieval Iran,Maria Subtelny,BRILL,2007-08-30,"How did the the descendants of Tamerlane, collectively known as the Timurids, make the transition from a nomadic empire to a sedentary polity based on the Perso-Islamic model , and what effect did the process of transition have on their Turko-Mongolian customs and identity? This volume seeks to answer these questions by utilizing the Weberian concepts of the “routinization” of charismatic authority and the patrimonial household state. Focusing on the period of the last Timurid ruler, Sulṭān-Ḥusain Bayqara (1469–1506), the author examines the impact of the introduction of Persian modes of bureaucratic administration on the evolution of Timurid government and describes the development of the agrarian economy of the eastern Iranian province of Khorasan through the Islamic institution of the pious endowment. Based on an exceptionally broad range of sources in Persian, Arabic, and Turkic languages, the book provides a new paradigm for understanding the Timurids within the framework of post-Mongol history and offers fresh insights into Turko-Persian relations and the problem of acculturation in medieval Iran.",438,Social Science,en,9789047421603,timurids

She provides a rich portrait of Iranian society over an exceptionally broad spectrum - the dynasty and its servitors, city elite and provincial rulers, and the religious classes, both ulama' and Sufi. The work addresses two issues central to pre-modern Middle Eastern history: how a government without the monopoly of force controlled a heterogeneous society, and how a society with diffuse power structures remained stable over long periods. Written for an audience of students as well as scholars, this book provides a broad analysis of political dynamics in late medieval Iran and challenges much received wisdom about civil and military power, the relationship of government to society, and the interaction of religious figures with the ruling class.",13,History,en,9781139462846,timurids

Making of the Artist in Late Timurid Painting,Balafrej Lamia Balafrej,Edinburgh University Press,2019-04-01,"In the absence of a tradition of self-portraiture, how could artists signal their presence within a painting? Centred on late Timurid manuscript painting (ca. 1470-1500), this book reveals that pictures could function as the painter's delegate, charged with the task of centring and defining artistic work, even as they did not represent the artist's likeness. Influenced by the culture of the majlis, an institutional gathering devoted to intricate literary performances and debates, late Timurid painters used a number of strategies to shift manuscript painting from an illustrative device to a self-reflective object, designed to highlight the artist's imagination and manual dexterity. These strategies include visual abundance, linear precision, the incorporation of inscriptions addressing aspects of the painting and the artist's signature. Focusing on one of the most iconic manuscripts of the Persianate tradition, the Cairo Bustan made in late Timurid Herat and bearing the signatures of the painter Bihzad, this book explores Persian manuscript painting as a medium for artistic performance and self-representation, a process by which artistic authority was shaped and discussed.",327,Art,en,9781474437462,timurids

Jalayirids Dynastic State Formation in the Mongol Middle East,Patrick Wing,Edinburgh University Press,2016-01-18,"This book traces the origins, history, and memory of the Jalayirid dynasty, a family that succeeded the Mongol Ilkhans in Iran and Iraq in the 14th and early 15th centuries. The story of how the Jalayirids came to power is illustrative of the political dynamics that shaped much of the Mongol and post-Mongol period in the Middle East. The Jalayirid sultans sought to preserve the social and political order of the Ilkhanate, while claiming that they were the rightful heirs to the rulership of that order. Central to the Jalayirids' claims to the legacy of the Ilkhanate was their attempt to control the Ilkhanid heartland of Azarbayjan and its major city, Tabriz. Control of Azarbayjan meant control of a network of long-distance trade between China and the Latin West, which continued to be a source of economic prosperity through the 8th/14th century. Azarbayjan also represented the center of Ilkhanid court life, whether in the migration of the mobile court-camp of the ruler, or in the complexes of palatial, religious and civic buildings constructed around the city of Tabriz by members of the Ilkhanid royal family, as well as by members of the military and administrative elite.",215,History,en,9781474410939,jalayirid

A Handbook of Islamic Coins,Michael Broome,Trafalgar Square Publishing,1985,"This book provides an introduction to the coinages of the Near and Middle East, issued by the various dynasties that emerged from the religious state established by the Prophet Muhammad. The Islamic coinages of India and South East Asia are excluded because they are derived from different monetary concepts and cultural backgrounds. Each chapter begins with a summary of the main historical changes that are relevant to a general study of the coinage. This is followed by detailed commentary on the coinage with reference to the illustrations. The latter are reproduced at actual size, the better to appreciate the motifs and especially the fine art of calligraphy which is the very epitome of Islamic art. Detailed captions to the illustrations provide a ""parallel text"" complementing the more general historical material. A particularly valuable feature of the book are the nine maps specially drawn for it which were prepared to show the mint towns of the different dynasties. From these the extent of the spread of Islamic culture and coinage can be well seen.",248,Antiques & Collectibles,en,,jalayirid

A Voyage to Modernism,Sir Sayyid Aḥmad K̲h̲ān̲,Primus Books,2011,"The nature of Muslim knowledge concerning the West through travel accounts makes for fascinating reading. The eighteenth-century encounters of Munshi Ihtisamuddin and Mirza Abu Taleb Khan, embedded in their travelogues, however, seem very distant and less urgent. With Syed Ahmed, however, begins an entirely new phase with his interplay between Muslims and the West, on the one hand, and between Islam and Christianity, on the other. Even though his portrait of England is sometimes facile, his account of his travels opens the door to new questions, particularly because this was the period when the relations between Europeans and Indians were at the centre of many debates. Consequently, passages in the Musafiran-i Landan introducing 'Europe' and 'England' are historically important enough to merit attention, since they are not used merely as fulsome descriptions of Western society's advances, but also contain the germ of the justification for an Anglo-Muslim rapprochement. This makes the Musafiran-i Landan an important source for the construction of the history of an era. Its English translation, the first ever to be undertaken in full, makes it accessible to those who have no knowledge of Urdu. Although several accounts of 'India and West' are available, A Voyage to Modernism is of special significance. Set apart from his later endeavours like the Tahzibul Akhlaq and Asar-al Sanadid, it is the Syed's impressions caught in A Voyage to Modernism that mattered to all those who knew anything about his standing in public life and his stature as an enlightened reformer in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. This eminently readable translation is enriched by editorial interventions by translators and editors of the work, and supported by rare archival photographs",254,Biography & Autobiography,en,9789380607078,sultanate of rum

"Affect, Emotion, and Subjectivity in Early Modern Muslim Empires: New Studies in Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal Art and Culture",Kishwar Rizvi,BRILL,2017-11-06,"Affect, Emotion and Subjectivity in Early Modern Muslim Empires presents new approaches to Ottoman Safavid and Mughal art and culture. Taking artistic agency as a starting point, the authors consider the rise in status of architects, the self-fashioning of artists, the development of public spaces, as well as new literary genres that focus on the individual subject and his or her place in the world. They consider the issue of affect as performative and responsive to certain emotions and actions, thus allowing insights into the motivations behind the making and, in some cases, the destruction of works of art. The interconnected histories of Iran,Turkey and India thus highlight the urban and intellectual changes that defined the early modern period.

The book traces the ebb and flow of empires, including the Byzantine and Seljuk, and the profound impact of religious conversion on the region's social and legal systems. It investigates how Turkish national identity emerged during the late Ottoman period, culminating in the Turkish War of Independence led by Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk. Uniquely, this book emphasizes the conscious effort to break from the past while preserving cultural heritage. The book presents a chronological narrative, starting with pre-Ottoman civilizations and meticulously detailing the Ottoman Empireâs expansion and decline. It examines critical events such as the Tanzimat Reforms and the Young Turk Revolution, leading to World War I and its aftermath. The analysis challenges simplistic views of Turkish history, highlighting the agency of Turkish nationalists in shaping their destiny.

Cross and Crescent in the Balkans The Ottoman Conquest of Southeastern Europe (14th - 15th Centuries),David Nicolle,,2010,"This is not just another retelling of the Fall of Constantinople, though it does include a very fine account of that momentous event. It is the history of a quite extraordinary century and a bit which began when a tiny force of Ottoman Turkish warriors was invited by the Christian Byzantine Emperor to cross the Dardanelles from Asia into Europe to assist him in one of the civil wars which were tearing the fast-declining Byzantine Empire apart. One hundred and eight years later the Byzantine capital of Constantinople fell to what was by then a hugely powerful and expanding empire of the Islamic Ottoman Turks, whose rulers came to see themselves as the natural and legitimate heirs of their Byzantine and indeed Roman predecessors. The book sets the scene, explains the background and tells the story, both military, political, cultural and personal, of the winners and the losers, plus those 'outsiders' who were increasingly being drawn into the dramatic story of the rise of the Ottoman Empire. AUTHOR: David Nicolle is a leading expert on the history of medieval warfare, in particular the Crusades and Middle Eastern warfare, and he is a prolific writer of books on these subjects as well as articles and magazine articles.

Comparing the tropes, characterization and settings of these literary phenomena, and focusing on gender, religion, and ethnicity, the study exposes the historical roots of current romance representations of the east, advancing research in Orientalism, (neo)medievalism and medieval cultural studies.

The History of Greece From Its Conquest by the Crusaders to Its Conquest by the Turks and of the Empire of Trebizond - 1204-1461,George Finlay,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2016-12-18,"The Empire of Trebizond or the Trapezuntine Empire was a monarchy that flourished during the 13th through 15th centuries, comprising the far northeastern corner of Anatolia and the southern Crimea. Original formed during a revolt against the usurpation of the imperial throne by the grandsons of Emperor Andronikos I Komneos, Trebizond (current Trabzon, Turkey, with which the name of the empire is a cognate) became a Byzantine Greek successor state established after the fall of the Earner Roman Empire (Byzantine) in the Fourth Crusade, along with the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus. The Emperors of Trebizond pressed their claim on the Imperial throne for decades after the Nicaean reconquest of Constantinople in 1261. The Trapezuntine monarchy survived the longest of the Byzantine successor states. The Despotate of Epirus was slowly decimated, and briefly occupied by the restored Byzantine Empire c.1340, thereafter becoming a Serbian dependency and later inherited by Italians, ultimately falling to the Ottoman Empire in 1479, having long ceased to contest the Byzantine throne. While the Empire of Nicaea had become the resurrected Byzantine Empire, it came to an end in 1453 with the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Empire. The Empire of Trebizond continued until 1461 when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II conquered it after a month-long siege and took its ruler and his family into captivity. The Crimean Principality of Theodoro, an offshoot of Trebizond, lasted another 14 years, falling to the Ottomans in 1475.",536,,en,1541189639,empire of trebizond
The Routledge Handbook of the Byzantine City From Justinian to Mehmet II (ca. 500 - ca.1500),"Nikolas Bakirtzis, Luca Zavagno",Taylor & Francis,2024-01-31,"The Byzantine world contained many important cities throughout its empire. Although it was not ‘urban’ in the sense of the word today, its cities played a far more fundamental role than those of its European neighbors. This book, through a collection of twenty-four chapters, discusses aspects of, and different approaches to, Byzantine urbanism from the early to late Byzantine periods. It provides both a chronological and thematic perspective to the study of Byzantine cities, bringing together literary, documentary, and archival sources with archaeological results, material culture, art, and architecture, resulting in a rich synthesis of the variety of regional and sub-regional transformations of Byzantine urban landscapes. Organized into four sections, this book covers: Theory and Historiography, Geography and Economy, Architecture and the Built Environment, and Daily Life and Material Culture. It includes more specialized accounts that address the centripetal role of Constantinople and its broader influence across the empire. Such new perspectives help to challenge the historiographical balance between ‘margins and metropolis,’ and also to include geographical areas often regarded as peripheral, like the coastal urban centers of the Byzantine Mediterranean as well as cities on islands, such as Crete, Cyprus, and Sicily which have more recently yielded well-excavated and stratigraphically sound urban sites. The Routledge Handbook of the Byzantine City provides both an overview and detailed study of the Byzantine city to specialist scholars, students, and enthusiasts alike and, therefore, will appeal to all those interested in Byzantine urbanism and society, as well as those studying medieval society in general.",719,History,en,9780429515750,empire of trebizond

Can China prevail in shaping global digital rulemaking? This edited volume seeks answers to these important questions. Divided into three parts, Part I examines how the central state has become a leading player and coordinated with various stakeholders, such as academic institutions, corporations, and local governments, in making digital technology policy. Part II analyses how the Chinese party-state used digital technology to strengthen authoritarian governance and how society has responded to digital authoritarianism. Part III explores China’s attempt to shape global digital rulemaking in competition with the US and other Western countries. This book is aimed at scholars, researchers, policymakers, and students with an interest in digital technology, international relations, Chinese politics, and authoritarian governance. It will also appeal to those studying AI, digital governance, and global power dynamics. The chapters in this book were originally published in the Journal of Contemporary China and come with a new introduction.",310,Business & Economics,en,9781040412916,yuan china
China’s Urban Agglomerations,"Chuanglin Fang, Danlin Yu",Springer Nature,2020-01-03,"The book combs through extensively 32,231 urban agglomeration related works during the past 120 years to explore a theoretically supported and practically based definition of urban agglomeration. Based on the definition, the authors explore intensively the fundamental characteristics, spatiotemporal differentiation properties, and existing issues for China’s sustainable urban agglomeration development for the past 35 years. The study proposes that China shall focus on the construction and sustainable development of five primary national-level urban agglomerations. In the meantime, China shall also steadily and gradually construct 9 regional urban agglomerations and guide the development and growth of 6 local urban agglomerations. In the long run, China will have a hierarchical “5+9+6” closely integrated hierarchical urban agglomeration spatial structure. The study also proposes to coordinate the construction and development of urban agglomerations on the “two belts and one road” to form a national new urbanization development strategic pattern that enables “the axis to connect the agglomerations while the agglomerations support the axis.” Furthermore, the study investigates a variety of strategic thinking and suggestions for creating innovative, green and ecologically friendly, intelligent, low-carbon, open, culture-oriented, market-oriented and shared urban agglomerations in China. This book will be a comprehensive reference both for scholars and decision-makers engaged in urban development and planning and environmental protection departments. It can also serve as textbook for graduate students of relevant fields.",281,Science,en,9789811515514,yuan china

Early Ukraine A Military and Social History to the Mid-19th Century,Alexander Basilevsky,McFarland,2016-04-05,"As the Dark Ages enveloped Europe, a civilization was born on the banks of the Dnieper River. Rus--whose capital at Kiev surpassed in grandeur most cities of Europe--was home to the Ukrainian people, whose princes made war on Constantinople and established the city states of what would become Russia. The cities of Rus were destroyed by the Mongols, their remains falling to the Polish-Lithuanian kingdom. With the steppe restored to wilderness, the ""kraina"" borderlands of the hardy frontiersmen known as Cossacks--who in the 17th century destroyed powerful Polish, Lithuanian and Muscovite armies--gained Ukrainian independence and established a unique social order. Drawing on English, Ukrainian and French sources, this book chronicles the military and social origins of Ukraine and describes the differences between Ukraine and its neighbors. The author refutes the claim that Ukraine and Russia were once united in a common political system.",407,History,en,9781476620220,vistula veneti

Following the Civil War and Sulla’s dictatorship, it developed further with the First Triumvirate of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, and two further civil wars. These wars, which saw Caesar pitted against Pompey, and Octavian fighting Anthony, ended in 27 BC with the rise to power of Octavian, the adoptive son of Caesar. Before Augustus outlines a summary of the last years of the Roman Republic, weaving together the military, political, and social aspects.

"Seljuqs Politics, Society and Culture",Christian Lange,Edinburgh University Press,2012-10-03,"Despite the many important developments and innovations traceable to the Seljuq period (5th-7th/11th-13th centuries), the Seljuqs remain one of the understudied Muslim dynasties. This unique collaborative exploration of the Seljuqs' achievement contributes to the growing interest in this pivotal dynasty. The various chapters in this volume cover a representative geographical spectrum, from Central Asia and Persia to Iraq, Syria and Anatolia, and address novel questions such as the ideological foundations and ritual expressions of Seljuq power, the mutual attitudes of the learned classes and the Seljuq state, the organization of space, and the relationship between nomads and the settled peoples.The book is divided into three parts: the origins of the Seljuqs, their gradual transformation into a powerful dynasty, and their concepts of political legitimization (part one); the social history of the Seljuq period, particularly with regard to the 'ulama' and the urban populations (part two); developments in religious thought, jurisprudence, belles-lettres and architecture under the Seljuqs (part three).Key Features*Brings together the work of leading international experts in Seljuq studies including C.

While many of the successor states to the Ottoman empire, in east and west, had been built on forms of nationalist ideology and rhetoric opposed to the empire, a newer trend among historians has been to look at these histories as Ottoman provincial history.

A History of the Muslim World From Its Origins to the Dawn of Modernity,Michael A.

The body of the book takes readers from the origins of Islam to the eve of the nineteenth century, and an epilogue continues the story to the present day. Michael Cook thus provides a broad history of a civilization remarkable for both its unity and diversity. After setting the scene in the Middle East of late antiquity, the book depicts the rise of Islam as one of the great black swan events of history. It continues with the spectacular rise of the Caliphate, an empire that by the time it broke up had nurtured the formation of a new civilization. It then goes on to cover the diverse histories of all the major regions of the Muslim world, providing a wide-ranging account of the key military, political, and cultural developments that accompanied the eastward and westward spread of Islam from the Middle East to the shores of the Atlantic and the Pacific. At the same time, A History of the Muslim World contains numerous primary-source quotations that expose the reader to a variety of acutely insightful voices from the Muslim past.",960,History,en,9780691236599,aq qoyunlu
Safavid Persia in the Age of Empires The Idea of Iran Vol. 10,Charles Melville,Bloomsbury Publishing,2021-02-25,"The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw the establishment of the new Safavid regime in Iran. Along with reuniting the Persian lands under one rule, the Safavids initiated the radical transformation of the religious landscape by introducing Imami Shi'ism as the official state faith and in this as in other ways, laying the foundations of Iran's modern identity. In this book, leading scholars of Iranian history, culture and politics examine the meaning of the idea of Iran in the Safavid period by examining contemporary experiences of both insiders and outsiders, asking how modern scholarship defines the distinctive features of the age. While sometimes viewed as a period of decline from the high points of classical Persian literature and the visual arts of preceding centuries, the chapters of this book demonstrate that the Safavid era was nevertheless a period of great literary and artistic activity in the realms of both secular and theological endeavour. With the establishment of comparable polities across western, southern and central Asia at broadly the same time, the book explores some of the literary and political interactions with Iran's Ottoman, Mughal and Uzbek neighbours. As the volume and frequency of European merchants and diplomats visiting Safavid Persia increased, especially in the seventeenth century, and as more Iranians recorded their own travel experiences to surrounding Muslim lands, the Safavid period is the first in which we can document and explore the contours of Iran's place in an expanding world, and gain insights into how Iranians saw themselves and others saw them.",491,History,en,9780755633807,aq qoyunlu
Medieval Persia 1040-1797,David Morgan,Routledge,2015-06-26,"Medieval Persia 1040-1797 charts the remarkable history of Persia from its conquest by the Muslim Arabs in the seventh century AD to the modern period at the end of the eighteenth century, when the impact of the west became pervasive. David Morgan argues that understanding this complex period of Persia’s history is integral to understanding modern Iran and its significant role on the international scene. The book begins with a geographical introduction and briefly summarises Persian history during the early Islamic centuries to place the country’s Middle Ages in their historical context. It then charts the arrival of the Saljūq Turks in the eleventh century and discusses in turn the major political powers of the period: Mongols, Timurids, Türkmen and Safawids. The chronological narrative enables students to identify change and consistencies under each ruling dynasty, while Persia’s rich social, cultural, religious and economic history is also woven throughout to present a complete picture of life in Medieval Persia. Despite the turbulent backdrop, which saw Persia ruled by a succession of groups who had seized power by military force, arts, painting, poetry, literature and architecture all flourished in the period. This new edition contains a new epilogue which discusses the significant literature of the last 28 years to provide students with a comprehensive overview of the latest historiographical trends in Persian history. Concise and clear, this book is the perfect introduction for students of medieval Persia and the medieval Middle East.",217,History,en,9781317415671,aq qoyunlu

Raghavan,HarperCollins,2017-01-15,"Bairam Khan and his son, Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan were soldiers, poets and courtiers whose lives reflected the turbulent times they lived in. In telling their stories, Attendant Lords spans the reigns of four emperors - Babur, Humayun, Akbar and Jahangir - and covers over a hundred years of Mughal history, a time when these two noblemen were at the very heart of the court's labyrinthine politics.After Humayun's untimely death, Bairam Khan was regent to the young Emperor Akbar for four critical years. Bairam's own son, Abdur Rahim, became one of the most important generals of the Mughal Empire, but he is best remembered for his literary prowess, most particularly for his famous 'dohas'. Literature plays a large part in this story.This unusual dual biography traces the lives of these two noblemen against the backdrop of the courtly intrigues, brutal power struggles and the grand literary endeavours of the Mughal court. And it looks at their afterlives - how politics and the Hindi-Urdu debate reincarnated them as national heroes; how both men came to be seen as standing at the confluence of Hinduism and Islam; how their life stories have undergone subtle transformations; and how history, religion and literature combine in the broader context of nationalism and nation building.",337,History,en,9789352643066,aq qoyunlu

The New Mamluks Egyptian Society and Modern Feudalism,Amira El-Azhary Sonbol,,2000-12,"Amira el-Azhary Sonbol has produced an analytical history of Egypt from the time before Muhammad Ali to the present day. Using local idioms and terms such as khassa and 'amma, iltazim and fa'iz, she has developed a methodology that is more meaningful because it ties events of the eighteenth century to those of the twentieth. The author explores the division that has existed in modern Egyptian society between two groups: the khassa, a ruling elite that tried to impose a hegemonic culture that reflected and encouraged its own economic interests, and the 'amma, the masses who clung to their heritage and customs in an attempt to acquire a share of the wealth. Sonbol discusses today's Islamic movement in Egypt as a revolution correcting the duality of culture that was brought about by historical events like colonialism and the importation of exogenous ideologies. She suggests a different way of looking at culture and the necessity of seeing cultural struggle as a method for studying the historical process that goes beyond the political and economical.",344,History,en,,mamluks

Exceptional movement, agility, speed, stamina.” This is how Horsetalk.co.nz describes the Akhal-Teke. Do you think they’re right? You may not know a lot about this horse, so let’s try to find out what makes it so special. Are you ready? Then let’s get started! The Akhal – Teke is an amazing horse with a beautiful coat that shines in the sun! That’s why many call it ‘the golden horse of the desert.’ Can you guess why these horses are called “golden horses?” You’re right! It is because of their beautiful coat. It shines in the light. Look at the pictures in this book and you will see it is true. This lovely horse comes all the way from Turkmenistan. They are so loved in this country that this horse is the National Emblem. Do you know what that means? An emblem is a symbol of something else. It can represent a family, nation or organization. In this case, the Akhal Teke represents the nation of Turkmenistan. Having a beautiful coat does not mean Akhal-Teke are not strong horses. They adapt very well to where they live and they are known as one of the oldest horse breeds. Would you like to know how tough they are? In 1935, Turkmen riders went from a place called Ashgabat (Known as: Ashkabad) to Moscow. It took 84 days to make the trip and a 3 day crossing over 235 miles of desert. The most amazing part of this story is how they did this WITHOUT water! I am thirsty even thinking about it. Do you think this would have been possible without the help of this magnificent horse? I don’t think so! The Akhal- Teke is a wonderful horse. It is so adaptable it can be used as a jumping horse, sport horse, racing, endurance riding horse and more. You might think this means the horse is tough and not friendly. But this is not true. Many people say this horse is not only “golden” in its color, but also “golden” in its personality. Keep reading to find out why!",28,Nature,en,9781310716744,teke

Ndyuka,"George L. Huttar, Mary L. Huttar",Routledge,2003-09-01,"This volume constitutes what is perhaps the most thorough description of a creole language to date. Following the Descriptive Grammar Series outline, it provides detailed coverage of a full range of grammatical, phonological and lexical information, written with the interests of formalists and functionalists, creolists and students of language universals and typology in mind. Expressions of lin-uistic judgements by both native and trained native speakers of Ndyuka combine with close study of texts to provide a solid basis for the work. More than two thousand examples of constructions and forms are considered in context and these give the careful reader a rich picture of all the stuctural and functional aspects of this radical creole. The authors' close acquaintance with the Ndyuka language community spans more than 25 years and allows the intuitions of Ndyuka speakers to show through clearly. Numerous cross references and an index of forms and topics of special interest supplement the detailed table of contents, facilitating the testing of hypotheses on language universals, typology, creolization, and processes such as clefting, relativization and verb serialization.",418,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,9781136861727,teke
Encyclopedia of Stateless Nations Ethnic and National Groups around the World,James B. Minahan,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2016-08-01,"This book addresses the numerous national movements of ethnic groups around the world seeking independence, more self-rule, or autonomy—movements that have proliferated exponentially in the 21st century. In the last 15 years, globalization, religious radicalization, economic changes, endangered cultures and languages, cultural suppression, racial tensions, and many other factors have stimulated the emergence of autonomy and independence movements in every corner of the world—even in areas formerly considered immune to self-government demands such as South America. Researching the numerous ethnic groups seeking autonomy or independence worldwide previously required referencing many specialized publications. This book makes this difficult-to-find information available in a single volume, presented in a simple format accessible to everyone, from high school readers to scholars in advanced studies programs. The book provides an extensive update to Greenwood's Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups around the World that was published more than a decade earlier.

Language Dispersal Beyond Farming,"Martine Robbeets, Alexander Savelyev",John Benjamins Publishing Company,2017-12-21,"Why do some languages wither and die, while others prosper and spread? Around the turn of the millennium a number of archaeologists such as Colin Renfrew and Peter Bellwood made the controversial claim that many of the world’s major language families owe their dispersal to the adoption of agriculture by their early speakers. In this volume, their proposal is reassessed by linguists, investigating to what extent the economic dependence on plant cultivation really impacted language spread in various parts of the world. Special attention is paid to ""tricky"" language families such as Eskimo-Aleut, Quechua, Aymara, Bantu, Indo-European, Transeurasian, Turkic, Japano-Koreanic, Hmong-Mien and Trans-New Guinea, that cannot unequivocally be regarded as instances of Farming/Language Dispersal, even if subsistence played a role in their expansion.",340,Language Arts & Disciplines,en,9789027264640,teke

The former wields no real power, kept impotent by the regents surrounding him. The latter mans the battle lines, determined to protect the kingdom from a fearsome, immortal god who was expelled from heaven. To the north, the city-state Chernagor is being torn asunder by a savage civil war that threatens to spill past the border at any moment.

Throughout emphasis has been placed on the lives of Ephesian individuals and groups, and their respective contributions to architecture, law, literature, painting, medicine, philosophy, poetry, politics, religion and sculpture, often at times characterized by political and territorial power struggles and ecclesiastical doctrinal controversies and disagreements. The history of Ephesus is of ongoing interest to historians, archaeologists and students of classical literature, science, religion and philosophy, as well as to amateurs and laymen who are keenly interested in Mediterranian antiquity. It is documented with excerpts, biographical references, explanatory footnotes and a few illustrations.",504,History,en,9781449716189,menteshe
The Scepter's Return,Harry Turtledove,Open Road Media,2015-12-15,"Two rival kings must unite to defeat a malevolent god in the ""wise and humorous"" conclusion to the Hugo Award–winning author's Scepter of Mercy trilogy ( Publishers Weekly). When Avornis falls, the Banished One will reign supreme. Rival kings Lanius and Grus each covet solitary power, but realize that a kingdom divided cannot stand against the evil god who enslaves the minds of men through their nightmares. Once, Avornis was safe from his dark influence, protected by a powerful talisman supplied by the pantheon of deities who expunged the immortal called Milvago from their ranks. But that was centuries earlier, before the Scepter of Mercy was lost, and only through its recovery can Avornis survive. Now, Lanius has a daring—most likely impossible—plan, but it requires the cooperation of his fellow ruler, the warrior and usurper king Grus. If they fail to work together they will die together nevertheless, along with everything that is good and right in their world. Hugo Award winner Harry Turtledove brings his Scepter of Mercy trilogy to a spectacular end with a story of courage, conflict, and selfless sacrifice. In The Scepter's Return, as in the previous books of the series, the acclaimed world-builder reimagines epic fantasy, leaving his own special imprint on the popular genre much as he has done with the alternate history for which he is so justifiably renowned.",422,Fiction,en,9781504027489,menteshe
Historians on Chaucer The 'General Prologue' to the Canterbury Tales,Alastair Minnis,OUP Oxford,2014-12-04,"As literary scholars have long insisted, an interdisciplinary approach is vital if modern readers are to make sense of works of medieval literature. In particular, rather than reading the works of medieval authors as addressing us across the centuries about some timeless or ahistorical 'human condition', critics from a wide range of theoretical approaches have in recent years shown how the work of poets such as Chaucer constituted engagements with the power relations and social inequalities of their time. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, medieval historians have played little part in this 'historical turn' in the study of medieval literature. The aim of this volume is to allow historians who are experts in the fields of economic, social, political, religious, and intellectual history the chance to interpret one of the most famous works of Middle English literature, Geoffrey Chaucer's 'General Prologue' to the Canterbury Tales, in its contemporary context. Rather than resorting to traditional historical attempts to see Chaucer's descriptions of the Canterbury pilgrims as immediate reflections of historical reality or as portraits of real life people whom Chaucer knew, the contributors to this volume have sought to show what interpretive frameworks were available to Chaucer in order to make sense of reality and how he adapted his literary and ideological inheritance so as to engage with the controversies and conflicts of his own day. Beginning with a survey of recent debates about the social meaning of Chaucer's work, the volume then discusses each of the Canterbury pilgrims in turn. Historians on Chaucer should be of interest to all scholars and students of medieval culture whether they are specialists in literature or history.",525,History,en,9780191003684,menteshe

The Bastard King,Dan Chernenko,,2003,"Lost for more than five hundred years, the Scepter of Mercy lies beyond the reach of the kingdom of Avornis, in the lands corrupted by the Banished One. Cast from the heavens to an earthly exile, the Banished One seeks to use the scepter to reclaim his godhood. But the intertwined destiny of two men may interfere with his ascension… Lanius is the only son of King Mergus of Avornis. But he is the son of a seventh wife—and therefore illegitimate in the eyes of church and state. So after the king’s death, the nobles use young Lanius as their figurehead while they rule behind the scenes. Grus is a captain in the king’s navy, a man of common origins, as well as common sense. His is charged with guarding the border from Avornis’ enemies—including those who live in thrall of the Banished One. He’s watched his homeland weaken under incompetent rulers—and fears for the future as disturbing visions torment his dreams. Now, both Lanius and Grus must decide what’s best for the kingdom before the influence of the Banished One spreads to their people. And so begins the quest for the Scepter of Mercy…",452,Fiction,en,0451459148,menteshe

"Rebuilding Anatolia after the Mongol Conquest Islamic Architecture in the Lands of Rum, 1240–1330",Patricia Blessing,Routledge,2016-12-05,"This book is a study of Islamic architecture in Anatolia following the Mongol conquest in 1243. Complex shifts in rule, movements of population, and cultural transformations took place that affected architecture on multiple levels. Beginning with the Mongol conquest of Anatolia, and ending with the demise of the Ilkhanid Empire, centered in Iran, in the 1330s, this book considers how the integration of Anatolia into the Mongol world system transformed architecture and patronage in the region. Traditionally, this period has been studied within the larger narrative of a progression from Seljuk to Ottoman rule and architecture, in a historiography that privileges Turkish national identity. Once Anatolia is studied within the framework of the Mongol Empire, however, the region no longer appears as an isolated case; rather it is integrated into a broader context beyond the modern borders of Turkey, Iran, and the Caucasus republics. The monuments built during this period served a number of purposes: mosques were places of prayer and congregation, madrasas were used to teach Islamic law and theology, and caravanserais secured trade routes for merchants and travelers. This study analyzes architecture on multiple, overlapping levels, based on a detailed observation of the monuments. The layers of information extracted from the monuments themselves, from written sources in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, and from historical photographs, shape an image of Islamic architecture in medieval Anatolia that reflects the complexities of this frontier region. New patrons emerged, craftsmen migrated between neighboring regions, and the use of locally available materials fostered the transformation of designs in ways that are closely tied to specific places. Starting from these sources, this book untangles the intertwined narratives of architecture, history, and religion to provide a broader understanding of frontier culture in the medieval Middle East, with its complex interaction of local, regional, and trans-regional identities.",323,History,en,9781351906289,saltukids

"The Crusader States and their Neighbours A Military History, 1099-1187",Nicholas Morton,Oxford University Press,2020-04-24,"The Crusader States and their Neighbours explores the military history of the Medieval Near East, piecing together the fault-lines of conflict which entangled this much-contested region. This was an area where ethnic, religious, dynastic, and commercial interests collided and the causes of war could be numerous. Conflicts persisted for decades and were fought out between many groups including Kurds, Turks, Armenians, Arabs, and the crusaders themselves. Nicholas Morton recreates this world, exploring how each faction sought to advance its own interests by any means possible, adapting its warcraft to better respond to the threats posed by their rivals. Strategies and tactics employed by the pastoral societies of the Central Asian Steppe were pitted against the armies of the agricultural societies of Western Christendom, Byzantium, and the Islamic World, galvanising commanders to adapt their practices in response to their foes. Today, we are generally encouraged to think of this era as a time of religious conflict, and yet this vastly over-simplifies a complex region where violence could take place for many reasons and peoples of different faiths could easily find themselves fighting side-by-side.",308,History,en,9780192557988,saltukids
Eastern Trade and the Mediterranean in the Middle Ages Pegolotti’s Ayas-Tabriz Itinerary and its Commercial Context,Thomas Sinclair,Routledge,2019-12-06,"At the end of the High Middle Ages in Europe, with buying power and economic sophistication at a high, an itinerary detailing the toll stations along a commercial artery carrying eastern goods (from China, India and Iran) towards Europe was compiled, and later incorporated in the well-known trading manual of the Florentine bank official Pegolotti; Pegolotti was twice stationed in the city of Famagusta in Cyprus, which lay opposite the city of Ayas where the land route ended. The Il-Khanid capital, Tabriz in Iran, attracting expensive merchandise such as spices and silk from a variety of origins, was the road’s starting-point. To demonstrate the importance of the route in its own time, parallel and contemporary routes in the Black Sea and the Levant are traced and the effect of trade on their cities noted. To compare the Ayas itinerary (1250s to 1330s) with previous periods the networks of commercial avenues in the previous period (1100-1250) and the subsequent one (1340s to 1500) are reconstructed. In each period the connection of east-west trade with the main movements of the European economy are fully drawn out, and the effects on the building history of the three main Italian cities concerned (Venice, Genoa and Florence) are sketched. Attention then turns to the Pegolotti itinerary itself. The individual toll stations are identified employing a variety of means, such as names taken from the Roman itineraries (Peutinger Table and Antonine Itinerary) and archaeological data; this allows the course of the track to be followed through diverse topography to the city of Sivas, then across plains and through passes to Erzurum and finally to Tabriz. A picture is drawn of the urban history of each major city, including Sivas, Erzurum and Tabriz itself, and of the other towns along the route.",390,Business & Economics,en,9781000752670,saltukids

Ottoman History - Misperceptions and Truths,"Ahmed Akgunduz, Said Ozturk",IUR Press,2011-01-01,"This book was first published in Turkish under the title Bilinmeyen Osmanlı, co-authored by Prof. Dr. Said Öztürk, and 250,000 copies were printed. I answered 290 questions whereas Öztürk answered 13 in total. He collaborated regarding source details and references as well as tirelessly proofreading and editing the book. In addition, this book was later translated into Arabic; the first edition was published by Osmanlı Araştirmalari Vakfi (OSAV), Istanbul, and the second will be published by Dār al-Shouroq in Cairo. The English version of this book has almost become a separate work from the aforementioned versions. Although the main part was translated into English by Ismail Ercan, the book needed a number of improvements and rewriting of some articles after referring to Western sources on the various subjects. Hence, I changed the title as well as the format of the book mainly for this reason. But I have indicated which articles were written by Prof. Öztürk. As preparation for this book, the questions it deals with have been discussed in academic research ever since 1983, and, in addition, hundreds of conferences have been held throughout Anatolia. As a result, over 5000 questions have accumulated in our “question desk,” submitted in written form by both readers and listeners. For example, the issue of ḥarem comes first, with 503 questions. The issue of whether the Ottoman Sulṭāns, particularly Bayezid the Thunderbolt, drank alcohol ranked second, with 276 questions. These were followed by such questions as fratricide rights and freedoms in the Ottoman state, the issue of the Sulṭāns going on pilgrimage, if Sulṭān Waḥīduddin was a traitor, etc. Needless to say, we have been inspired by similar research done in this field. This book will consist of four parts. In Part One we will deal with weighty questions on the political history of the Ottoman state and the replies to them. However, such questions are most frequently asked about each Sulṭān – even if they are related to law or economics. For instance, we will not ignore the issue of fratricide in his law when discussing Meḥmed the Conqueror and the charges of the genocide of the Kurds when it comes to Selim the Excellent. In Part Two we will deal with the questions on social life in the Ottoman state and the ḥarem. In Part Three we will look at those issues regarding the Ottoman legislative system and the organization of the state. In Part Four we will answer some questions about the economy and financial law of the Ottoman state. Unfortunately, we will not deal with all the questions we have received in all the aforesaid fields owing to insufficient space. Yet it is our view that if something cannot be achieved completely, we should not give up entirely and resign ourselves to what has been done. There are 307 differents subjects in this book; some of them as below: - War (jihād) in the Ottoman state and the legal principles of the policy of conquest in the Ottoman state - The Devşirme (Conscription) System - The allegations that the Ottoman state adhered to the Bektaşi and Aleviyye traditions during the years of its foundation until Sulṭān Selim the Excellent and that the Abdalan-ı Rum consisted of Bektaşi Babas and Alevi Dedes. - On rumors that some Ottoman Sulṭāns were addicted to alcohol and even held illegitimate carousals at the Palace. - The legality of fratricide in the Ottoman state and some claims by some historians regarding savagery and massacre for the sake of claiming the Sultanat. - There are claims that Sulṭān Meḥmed the Conqueror was sympathetic toward Christianity and corresponded with the Pope. - On the Ottoman State offering assistance to the Andalusian state that was destroyed in 1492. - Ottoman Harem. - Ottoman legal codes. - Ottoman legal system and Islamic law. - Which events sowed the seeds of hatred between Arabs and Turks, both of whom are Muslims? - The reasons for the decline and fall of the Ottoman State. - The capitulations as one reason for terminating the Ottoman State.",694,Religion,en,9789090261089,kayi tribe

The book is based on the original Persian and Arabic sources for the period, and describes the process by which, from a Turkish steppe background, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna and his son Mas'ud assembled by force of arms the most powerful empire known in the Islamic world since the disintegration of the Baghdad caliphate. Much of the Sultans' energy was devoted to the exploitation of India, with its rich temple treasures and reserves of slave manpower, and Mahmud in particular achieved a great contemporary reputation as a hammer of pagans and heretics, before the attacks of a new wave of Turkish invaders from Central Asia, the Ozhuz, overran the western provinces of their empire by 1040.",360,History,en,,ghaznavids

Friedberg, Robert Friedberg",Coin & Currency Institute,2017-01-05,"A unique and indispensable reference work Unsurpassed in content and scope When the first edition of Gold Coins of the World made its debut in 1958, it forever changed the way gold coins were collected, cataloged, traded, and priced. For the first time, one book provided a reliable guide for a subject which previously required an often expensive investment in multiple volumes of literature, some of it rare and antique, and much of it badly out-of-date. With the publication of this pioneering work, Robert Friedberg (1912-1963) established himself as an international icon in the field of numismatic literature. This book, and the 'Friedberg Numbering System' he developed became then, and is still today, the internationally-recognized standard for systematically identifying any gold coin ever made. From just 384 pages in 1958, Gold Coins of the World has expanded to the extent that it now contains more than triple the information of its ancestor. It still stands alone as the first and only book to describe, catalog and price two millennia of gold, platinum, and palladium coin issues from across the globe. From the first coins of the ancient Greeks to the most recently-issued modern commemoratives, they are all here, an astonishing compilation of more than 21,000 individual coin listings accompanied by over 8,000 actual-size photographs. The prices have been completely updated, for the most part raised substantially, to reflect the current market. Entire sections have been expanded, many illustrations have been added or improved, and hundreds of new discoveries and recent issues have been included for the first time.

The Baloch and Balochistan A Historical Account from the Beginning to the Fall of the Baloch State,Naseer Dashti,Trafford Publishing,2012-10,"Three thousand years ago, a group of Indo-Iranic tribes (called Balaschik at that time) settled in the northwestern Caspian region of Balashagan. Circumstances forced them to disperse and migrate towards south and eastern parts of Iranian plateau. In medieval times, they finally settled in present Balochistan where they became known as the Baloch. During their long and tortuous journey from Balashagan to Balochistan, the Baloch faced persecutions, deportations, and genocidal acts of various Persian, Arab and other regional powers. During 17th century, after dominating Balochistan culturally and politically, the Baloch carved out a nation state (the Khanate of Kalat). In 1839, the British occupied Balochistan and subsequently it was divided into various parts. In the wake of the British withdrawal from India in 1947, Balochistan regained its sovereignty but soon Pakistan occupied it in 1948. The historical account of the Baloch is the story of a pastoralist nomadic people from ancient times to mid-twentieth century. The author outlines the origin of the Baloch state and its variegated history of survival against powerful neighbors such as the Persians, the British and finally, Pakistan. This fascinating research work discovers the background of the long drawn-out conflict between the Baloch and Pakistan and Iranian states.",425,History,en,9781466958968,ghaznavids
The Ornament of Histories: A History of the Eastern Islamic Lands AD 650-1041 The Persian Text of Abu Sa‘id ‘Abd al-Hayy Gardizi,C. Edmund Bosworth,Bloomsbury Publishing,2011-02-28,"Abu Sa'id 'Abd al-Hayy Gardizi was a Persian author and historian living in the mid-eleventh century at the height of the Turkish Ghazvanid dynasty. His only known work, The Ornament of Histories ('Zayn al-akhbar'), is a hugely ambitious history of the Eastern Islamic lands 650-1041 AD, spanning what is now Eastern Iran, Afghanistan and parts of the Central Asian Republics and Indo-Pakistan subcontinent. Gardizi's text is an extremely rare source of primary information about the rise of Islamic faith, culture and military dominance in these regions, and represents a significant contribution to our understanding of the early Islamic world. Covering the four centuries from the first Arab conquests to his own time, Gardizi's work is a prime source, for some episodes the sole one, for the history of these lands at this time. Thus it is the sole source for events at the end of Sultan Mas'ud's reign, when the Sultan was killed in an army coup, having just lost the whole of the empire's Persian provinces to the incoming Seljuq Turks, and it was the Seljuqs who were now to dominate the central and eastern Islamic lands for a century and a half, almost till the invasion of the Mongols. Writing on the far-eastern fringes of what was then the Eastern Islamic world, in what is now Afghanistan, Gardizi also included important ethnological information on the Turkish tribes of Inner Eurasia and on the religions and philosophies of the Indians. But his prime interest was clearly the Islamic history of his own lands, the eastern Iranian world and its Central Asian and Indian fringes, and here he provides a detailed narrative. This book provides the first translation into a Western language of this history of the formative period of the Eastern Islamic world and gives an explanatory commentary, detailing the historical, geographical and cultural context, and well as the events and colourful characters mentioned in it.",186,History,en,9780857719577,ghaznavids

The Rum Seljuqs Evolution of a Dynasty,Songul Mecit,Routledge,2013-12-04,"Charting the expansion of the Rum Seljuqs from rulers of a small principality to a fully- fledged sultanate ruling over almost the whole of Anatolia, this book demonstrates how ideology, rather than military success, was crucial in this development. The Rum Seljuqs examines four distinct phases of development, beginning with the rule of Sulaymān (473-478/1081-1086) and ending with the rule of Kay Khusraw II (634-644/ 1237-1246). Firstly, Songül Mecit examines the Great Seljuq ideology as a pre-cursor to the ideology of the Rum Seljuqs. Continuing to explore the foundation of the Seljuq principality in Nicaea, the book then examines the third phase and the period of decline for the Great Seljuqs. Finally, the book turns to the apogee of the Rum Seljuq state and questions whether these sultans can, at this stage, be considered truly Perso-Islamic rulers? Employing the few available Rum Seljuq primary sources in Arabic and Persian, and drawing on the evidence of coins and monumental inscriptions, this book will be of use to scholars and students of History and Middle East Studies.",249,History,en,9781134508990,ghaznavids
"The Making of Medieval Panjab Politics, Society and Culture c. 1000–c. 1500",Surinder Singh,Routledge,2019-09-30,"This book seeks to reconstruct the past of undivided Panjab during five medieval centuries. It opens with a narrative of the efforts of Turkish warlords to achieve control in the face of tribal resistance, internal dissensions and external invasions. It examines the linkages of the ruling class with Zamindars and Sufis, paving the way for canal irrigation and agrarian expansion, thus strengthening the roots of the state in the region. While focusing on the post-Timur phase, it tries to make sense of the new ways of acquiring political power. This work uncovers the perpetual attempts of Zamindars to achieve local dominance, particularly in the context of declining presence of the state in the countryside. In this ambitious enterprise, they resorted to the support of their clans, adherence to hallowed customs and recurrent use of violence, all applied through a system of collective and participatory decision-making. The volume traces the growth of Sufi lineages built on training disciples, writing books, composing poetry and claiming miraculous powers. Besides delving into the relations of the Sufis with the state and different sections of the society, it offers an account of the rituals at a prominent shrine. Paying equal attention to the southeastern region, it deals with engagement of the Sabiris, among other exemplars, with the Islamic spirituality. Inclusive in approach and lucid in expression, the work relies on a wide range of evidence from Persian chronicles, Sufi literature and folklore, some of which have been used for the first time.

From the time of the arrival of the Crusaders in the Levant, their activities and the Muslim response become the focus of the work. While continuing with the aim of comprehensive coverage, the years in this part are dominated by the careers of Nur al-Din and Saladin, the champions of the Jihad, sometimes called the 'counter-crusade'. Of special interest is the historian's partiality for the House of the former, and his perceived hostility to Saladin.",476,History,en,9781351892841,ghaznavids

Encyclopedia of New Populism and Responses in the 21st Century,"Joseph Chacko Chennattuserry, Madhumati Deshpande, Paul Hong",Springer Nature,2024-12-02,"This book mainly seeks to explain, define and update the recurring forms of populism in the 21st century. Examples used in this Introduction are limited to English speaking countries. But populism's existent expressions are ecumenically global. Like any long-lasting perennial organism it is sturdy and comes in a variety of forms adaptable to environmental changes. In political or cultural terms its expression has been neither exclusively left, center, nor right. Populism contains multitudes, dates back centuries before it was identified with its modern name. Populism has become a hot button issue in the recent times. The UK's Sunday heavy The Guardian published about 300 articles in 1998 that used the term ""populism"" or ""populist"" and by 2016 its use had skyrocketed to over 2,000. And growing. Probably the single greatest catalyst to date that injected populism into the world's Internet common discourse, that infused it into journalism right, left and centerand awakened populist political activism was the Great Recession of 2007-08 and the subsequent global deprivations it engendered. In today's world populism promises to remain and renew its intensity due to the covid-19 pandemic's deleterious effects on most nations middle and low-income groups, specially minorities. These are some reasons among many why it is time for populism to be relocated, identified and given refreshed 21st understandings. It has a shifting nature among people, events, causes that constantly demands fresh studies. It is a social and cultural phenomenon both universal and particular. In our 21st century world it is a product of our shared cultures and each our own exceptional deep culture.

"Seafarers, Merchants and Pirates in the Middle Ages",Dirk Meier,Boydell Press,2006,"The first sailors braved the North Sea and the Baltic in open wooden boats: their aims were varied - to fish, to trade, to conquer and plunder. Without maps or compasses, they steered by the sun or by landmarks on the coast. Nevertheless they discovered Iceland and North America and explored the rivers that flowed through Europe and Russia into the Black Sea. With the Frisians and the Vikings, extensive trade routes, better ships, larger harbours and wealthy coastal towns developed. The pinnacle of these advances was the Hansa, a commercial network that ran from Bruges to Riga. In recent years archaeologists have discovered much about the development of their ships: the elegant Viking longboat, the ubiquitous cog, the carrack and the caravel. Much, too, has been revealed about life in Viking settlements and the bustling Hanseatic cities. In this engaging and highly-illustrated volume, Dirk Meier brings to life the world of the medieval seaman, based on evidence from ship excavations and contemporary accounts of voyages.

"The Sea in World History Exploration, Travel, and Trade [2 volumes]",Stephen K. Stein,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2017-04-24,"This two-volume set documents the essential role of the sea and maritime activity across history, from travel and food production to commerce and conquest. In all eras, water transport has served as the cheapest and most efficient means of moving cargo and people over any significant distance. Only relatively recently have railroads and aircraft provided an alternative. Most of the world's bulk goods continue to travel primarily by ship over water. Even today, 95 percent of the cargo that enters and leaves the United States does so by ship. Similarly, people around the world rely on the sea for food, and in recent years, the sea has become an important source of oil and other resources, with the longterm effects of our continuing efforts to extract resources from the sea further highlighting environmental concerns that range from pollution to the exhaustion of fish stocks. This chronologically organized two-volume reference addresses the history of the sea, beginning with ancient civilizations (4000 to 1000 BCE) and ending with the modern era (1945 to the present day). Each of the eight chapters is further broken down into sections that focus on specific nations or regions, offering detailed descriptions of that area of the world and shorter entries on specific topics, individuals, and events. The book spans maritime history, covering major seafaring peoples and nations; famous explorers, travelers, and commanders; events, battles, and wars; key technologies, including famous ships; important processes and ongoing events, such as piracy and the slave trade; and more. Readers will benefit from dozens of primary source documents—ranging from ancient Egyptian tales of seafaring to texts by renowned travelers like Marco Polo, Zheng He, and Ibn Battuta—that provide firsthand accounts from the age of discovery as well as accounts of battle from World War I and II and more modern accounts of the sea.",857,History,en,9798216142713,baltic slavic piracy

America is currently in a New Cold Civil War, it is at a critical inflection point and faces the most serious threat to its democracy in its history.

We are also overlooking the fact that the rhetoric in both the social and Main-stream Media are being monopolized by the same special interest groups that funds the Activists and control a majority of information technology companies. While muckraker journalists used to look out for our interests, today the media are mostly in cahoots with the tech companies as well as celebrities, activist judges, corporations, and Wall Street capitalists.

It examines how Medina became the crucible for the development of Islamic identity, law, and culture, deeply influencing political and social structures across the Muslim world. One intriguing aspect is the book's exploration of the Constitution of Medina, drafted during the Prophet Muhammad's time, which laid the foundation for an Islamic state. The compilation of Hadith and its impact on Islamic jurisprudence are also thoroughly analyzed, illustrating Medina's central role in shaping Islamic law and tradition. The book approaches the subject by examining pre-Islamic Medina, the Prophet's arrival, and the establishment of Islamic institutions, highlighting Medina's enduring legacy as a source of religious authority. By drawing on primary and secondary sources, the book provides a balanced perspective on Medina's impact on Islamic civilization. The book progresses chronologically and thematically, analyzing key events and concluding with an assessment of Medina's long-term influence on contemporary Islamic thought, making it a valuable resource for understanding the complexities of Islamic civilization and its continuing impact on the world.",164,Religion,en,9788233962104,rashidun caliphate
Parable and Politics in Early Islamic History The Rashidun Caliphs,Tayeb El-Hibri,Columbia University Press,2010-10-19,"The story of the succession to the Prophet Muhammad and the rise of the Rashidun Caliphate (632-661) is familiar to historians from the political histories of medieval Islam, which treat it as a factual account. The story also informs the competing perspectives of Sunni and Shi'i Islam, which read into it the legitimacy of their claims. Yet while descriptive and varied, these approaches have long excluded a third reading, which views the conflict over the succession to the Prophet as a parable. From this vantage point, the motives, sayings, and actions of the protagonists reveal profound links to previous texts, not to mention a surprising irony regarding political and religious issues. In a controversial break from previous historiography, Tayeb El-Hibri privileges the literary and artistic triumphs of the medieval Islamic chronicles and maps the origins of Islamic political and religious orthodoxy. Considering the patterns and themes of these unified narratives, including the problem of measuring personal qualification according to religious merit, nobility, and skills in government, El-Hibri offers an insightful critique of both early and contemporary Islam and the concerns of legitimacy shadowing various rulers. In building an argument for reading the texts as parabolic commentary, he also highlights the Islamic reinterpretation of biblical traditions, both by Qur'anic exegesis and historical composition.",489,History,en,9780231521659,rashidun caliphate

This book not only offers a substantial investigation of the idea and reality of decline, but also provides new interpretations of the inner workings of the court and the empire.

Islamisation Comparative Perspectives from History,A. C. S.

Taking a comparative perspective, both the historical trajectory of Islamisation and the methodological problems in its study are addressed, with coverage moving from Africa to China and from the seventh century to the start of the colonial period in 1800. Key questions are addressed. What is meant by Islamisation? How far was the spread of Islam as a religion bound up with the spread of Muslim culture? To what extent are Islamisation and conversion parallel processes? How is Islamisation connected to Arabisation? What role do vernacular Muslim languages play in the promotion of Muslim culture? The broad, comparative perspective allows readers to develop a thorough understanding of the process of Islamisation over eleven centuries of its history.",545,Reference,en,9781474417136,muslim conquest of persia

"Popular Muslim Reactions to the Franks in the Levant, 1097–1291",Alex Mallett,Routledge,2016-03-23,"The issue of Muslim reactions to the Franks has been an important part of studies of both the Crusades and Islamic History, but rarely the main focus. This book examines the reactions of the Muslims of the Levant to the arrival and presence of the Franks in the crusading period, 1097-1291, focussing on those outside the politico-military and religious elites. It provides a thematic overview of the various ways in which these 'non-elites' of Muslim society, both inside and outside of the Latin states, reacted to the Franks, arguing that it was they, as much as the more famous Muslim rulers, who were initiators of resistance to the Franks. This study challenges existing views of the Muslim reaction to the crusaders as rather slow and demonstrates that jihad against the Franks started as soon as they arrived. It further demonstrates the difference between the concepts of jihad and of Counter-Crusade, and highlights two distinct phases in the jihad against the Franks: the 'unofficial jihad' - that which occurred before uniting of religious and political classes - and the 'official jihad' - which happened after and due to this unification, and which has formed the basis of modern discussions. Finally, the study also argues that the Muslim non-elites who encountered the Franks did not always resist them, but at various times either helped or were unresisting to them, thus focussing attention away from conflict and onto cooperation. In considering Muslim reactions to the Franks in the context of wider discourses, this study also highlights aspects of the nature of Islamic society in Egypt and Syria in the medieval period, particularly the non-elite section of society, which is often ignored. The main conclusions also shed light on discourses of collaboration and resistance which are currently focussed almost exclusively on the modern period or the medieval west.",189,History,en,9781317077985,muslim conquest of the levant

The present collection, the second by Benjamin Kedar in the Variorum series, presents facts that require a modification of these still largely prevailing views. The earliest laws of the Kingdom of Jerusalem were influenced by Byzantine legislation; medical routine in the Jerusalem Hospital, unparalleled in Europe, had counterparts in Oriental hospitals; worshippers of different creeds repeatedly converged; multi-directional conversion recurred time after time. Several articles deal with groups that did abstain from intercultural contacts: Muslim villagers, Frankish clerics and hermits. One article dwells on the asymmetry of Frankish and Muslim mutual perceptions. The volume concludes with studies of specific locations: one argues that Acre was considerably larger than hitherto assumed, another compares its Venetian and Genoese quarters and attempts to locate the remains of a main street, a third reconstructs the history of Caymont.",339,History,en,9781040247112,muslim conquest of the levant

Rather than focusing on 'the Turkey trade' itself, or on the merchants who engaged in it, Christine Laidlaw examines the supporting cast of Britons - officials, clergymen, physicians and accompanying family members - who lived and worked alongside the merchants at the Company's three principal trading posts at Istanbul, Izmir and Aleppo during the eighteenth century.

"Heraclius, the Alchemical Emperor",Alexander Craig,Grosvenor House Publishing,2021-10-28,"This is more than just a story; it is a tale of life, courage and alchemy; of change, death and above all the power of love. Love of oneself, love of people and love of a goal, a purpose. It is also a lesson in the power of belief and the power to succeed against all odds. Regarded by historians and people at the time as the Roman Emperor's most gifted and respected rulers, Heraclius took on the Persians after a monumental struggle that reflected his own internal battles. A man history has never recognised in the same way as Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar but who was equally as influential. A truly inspirational emperor, who came to the aid of a crumbling empire at a time when it desperately needed his help and courage. The story starts in 601 AD, 125 years after the deposition of the last emperor in the West, the abdication of Romulus Augustus and 261 years after Constantine I relocated the capital of the Roman Empire to Constantinople. From this time the Roman Empire's most important territory existed in the East survived the fall of the West to forge a distinct and new Eastern identity where Greek speaking became the norm. Citizens of this empire continued to call themselves Romaioi or Romans, although it was only later that history identified their civilisation by the name of Byzantium, after the original name of the city of Constantinople.

One of the first historians to construct a Mohammedan history from the unreliable oral and written sources common in his era, Al-Hakam was from a reputable and well-respected family, renowned in the many branches of Hadith (narrations concerning the prophet Mohammed) and Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). This made Al-Hakam one of the most qualified individuals to compile and record the Muslim tradition in Egypt in his day.",448,History,en,9781616404352,muslim conquest of egypt

"The Multilingual Experience in Egypt, from the Ptolemies to the Abbasids",Arietta Papaconstantinou,"Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.",2010,"The wealth of documentary sources preserved by Egypt's papyri makes the country a privileged observation ground for the study of ancient multilingualism. Papyri capture more linguistic registers than other ancient and medieval sources, ranging as they do from very private documents not meant by their author to be read by future generations, to official documents produced by the administration, which are preserved in their original form. This collection of essays aims to make this wealth better known, as well as to give a diachronic view of multilingual practices in Egypt from the arrival of the Greeks as a political force in the country with Alexander the Great, to the beginnings of Abbasid rule when Greek, and slowly also Coptic, receded from the documentary record.",254,History,en,0754665364,muslim conquest of egypt

The Decline and Rise of Democracy A Global History from Antiquity to Today,David Stasavage,Princeton University Press,2021-08-24,"""Historical accounts of democracy's rise tend to focus on ancient Greece and pre-Renaissance Europe. The Decline and Rise of Democracy draws from global evidence to show that the story is much richer--democratic practices were present in many places, at many other times, from the Americas before European conquest, to ancient Mesopotamia, to precolonial Africa. Delving into the prevalence of early democracy throughout the world, David Stasavage makes the case that understanding how and where these democracies flourished--and when and why they declined--can provide crucial information not just about the history of governance, but also about the ways modern democracies work and where they could manifest in the future.""--",424,History,en,9780691228976,muslim conquest of egypt
The Muslim Conquest and Settlement of North Africa and Spain,'Abdulwāhid Dḥanūn Ṭāha,Routledge,2020-04-23,"In the seventh and eighth centuries, the Muslim Arabs conquered large areas of North Africa and then, with the help of their former adversaries in North Africa, the Berbers, gained a decisive victory over the Visigoths in Spain. This book, first published in 1989 and based on Arabic and other sources, describes the process of conquest and settlement, first depicting the lack of unity in North Africa and the corruption and insolvency in Spain that made the advance possible. It provides an invaluable classification of the Arab and Berber settlers in Spain by tribal origin, area of settlement and time of entry. The book emphasises throughout the importance of the economic and administrative relationship between North Africa and Spain. It charts the growing resentment of the early settlers in Spain with the restrictions on their autonomy imposed by the Governor-General of North Africa and the caliphate. It describes the rising tensions between old and new settlers and between the different tribal groups, finally leading to the Berber revolt and Abdulrahman’s consolidation of power towards the end of the Umayyad caliphate.",256,History,en,9781000639360,muslim conquest of maghreb

A History of the Maghrib in the Islamic Period,Jamil M. Abun-Nasr,Cambridge University Press,1987-08-20,"Building on the two previous editions of his History of the Maghrib, Professor Abun-Nasr has written a completely new history of North Africa within the Islamic period which begins with the Arab conquest and brings the story up to the present day. He emphasises the factors which led to the adoption of Islam by practically the entire population, the geographical position of the area, which made it the main trade link between the Mediterranean world and the Sudan and led to its involvement in the confrontation between the Christian and Islamic worlds. In Morocco, this confrontation led to the emergence of a distinct religio-political community ruled by sharifian dynasties and, in the rest of the Maghrib, to integration in the Ottoman empire. The political and economic developments of the 'piratical' regencies of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, the establishment of European colonial rule, the nationalist movements and Islamic religious reform are all treated in detail.

The Atlantic basin is central to most of these comparisons, but they are a part of an even broader effort to capture the perspective of world history.

Disease was particularly important for migrants who moved from one disease environment to another. In the tropical Atlantic, disease was a crucial factor in the formation of the slave trade, affecting both the involuntary passengers and those who came out from Europe to manage the trade.",378,Business & Economics,en,,muslim conquest of maghreb
Anastasius I Politics and Empire in the Late Roman World,Fiona K. Haarer,Francis Cairns Publications,2006,"""F. K. Haarer systematically explores the interlocking reforms of Anastasius, and his governance of the late fifth-century empire. His use of diplomacy in foreign policy is highlighted: in the east, relations with the Arabs before war broke out with Persia in 502; in the west, attempts to come to a modus vivendi with Theoderic and to strengthen ties with the Franks and Burgundians. It is shown that Anastasius, although failing in his attempts to heal the Empire's acrimonious doctrinal rifts, forged solid achievements in many aspects of administration: tax and coinage reforms, agrarian legislation, army restructuring, control of the factions, and a well-planned building programme.""

This volume of al-Ṭabarī's History has a particularly wide sweep and interest. It provides the most complete and detailed historical source for the Persian empire of the Sāsānids, whose four centuries of rule were one of the most glorious periods in Persia's long history. It also gives information on the history of pre-Islamic Arabs of the Mesopotamian desert fringes and eastern Arabia (in al-Hira and the Ghassanid kingdom), and on the quite separate civilization of South Arabia, the Yemen, otherwise known mainly by inscriptions. It furnishes details of the centuries'-long warfare of the two great empires of Western Asia, the Sāsānids and the Byzantine Greeks, a titanic struggle which paved the way for the subsequent rise of the new faith of Islam. The volume is thus of great value for scholars, from Byzantinists to Semitists and Iranists. It provides the first English translation of this key section of al-Ṭabarī's work, one for which non-Arabists have hitherto relied on a partial German translation, meritorious for its time but now 120 years old.

The detailed study of these buildings contributes to our understanding of Byzantine provincial art and architecture in Oriens, as they were adopted by the federate Arabs and later adapted to their own use. As monuments of Christian architecture, these federate structures constitute the missing link in the development of Arab architecture in the region--the link between the earlier pagan (Nabataean and Palmyrene) and later Muslim (Umayyad).",516,History,en,0884022846,lakhmids
The Armies of Ancient Persia The Sassanians,Kaveh Farrokh,Pen and Sword,2014-02-28,"Throughout most of the classical period, Persia was one of the great superpowers, placing a limit on the expansion of Western powers. It was the most formidable rival to the Roman empire for centuries, until Persia, by then under the Sassanians, was overwhelmed by the Islamic conquests in the seventh century AD. Yet, the armies of ancient Persia have received relatively little detailed attention, certainly in comparison to those of Rome. This work is the firsst of three volumes that will form the most comprehensive study of ancient Persian armies available.The Sassanians, the native Iranian dynasty that ousted their Parthian overlords in AD 226, developed a highly sophisticated army that was able for centuries to hold off all comers. They continued the Parthians famous winning combination of swift horse archers with heavily-armored cataphract cavalry, also making much use of war elephants, but Kaveh Farrokh interestingly demonstrates that their oft-maligned infantry has been much underestimated.The author, born in Athens, Greece, and expert in ancient Persian languages and military history, has been researching the military history and technology of Persia for a quarter of a century.

The Church of the East An Illustrated History of Assyrian Christianity,Christoph Baumer,Bloomsbury Publishing,2016-09-05,"The so-called 'Nestorian' Church (officially known as the Apostolic Assyrian Church of the East, with its See in Baghdad) was one of the most significant Christian communities to develop east of the Roman Empire. In its heyday the Church had 8 million adherents and stretched from the Mediterranean to China. Christoph Baumer is one of the very few Westerners to have visited many of the most important Assyrian sites and has written the only comprehensive history of the Church, which now fights for survival in its country of origin, Iraq, and is almost forgotten in the West. He narrates its rich and colorful trajectory, from its apostolic beginnings to the present day, and discusses the Church's theology, christology, and uniquely vigorous spirituality. He analyzes the Church's turbulent relationship with other Christian chuches and its dialogue with neighboring world religions such as Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Islam, Buddhism, and Taoism.

"An Introduction to the History of the Assyrian Church Or the Early Christians of the Sassanid Persian Empire, 100-640 A.D.",W. A. Wigram,,2019-09-25,"This insightful history sheds light on the early Christian church of Assyria, during the time of the Sassanid Persian Empire that ruled from the 2nd to the 7th centuries AD. The author's mission is to provide a coherent and sequential narrative of the development of Christianity during the period, that readers may understand how the Christian beliefs took root and flourished. Later, the established church of the east was threatened by persecutions from figures who opposed the spread of Christianity. The sophisticated nature of the church hierarchy, and the extent of its influence upon the rulers and political elements of the Sassanid Persian state, are detailed. Prosperous and ascendant, Sassanid Persia proved to be fertile ground for the development of the new religious culture. An atmosphere of tolerance saw a variety of religions practiced in the Middle East, with Christianity in the ascendance. Despite this, many areas in the Sassanid Empire had little or no Christian worship, and churches were never built upon anywhere close to all the Empire's territory. This period of expansion proved short-lived: by the 4th century persecutions had grown in frequency, and in the 7th century a calamitous war between Persia and Byzantine was accompanied by the spread of a new creed - Islam. Fortuitously the Assyrian church negotiated status as a minority religion, which afforded it legal protection and continuation for centuries to follow.",182,Religion,en,1789871107,assyrian church
The Rites of Christian Initiation Their Evolution and Interpretation,Maxwell E. Johnson,Liturgical Press,2007,"Originally published in 1999, The Rites of Christian Initiation was haled for its clarity and comprehensiveness. Kalian McDonnell, OSB, called it the best overall treatment of Christian initiation available, and Paul Bradshaw predicted it would be the standard textbook on the subject for very many years to come."" The current edition draws on new translations of early texts on baptism as well as recent scholarship on the early traditions in the East and West. It is sure to replace itself as the new standard reference on the rites of Christian initiation. Maxwell E. Johnson's expanded and revised text provides a more complete view of the history and interpretation of the rites in the Eastern Church, including two chapters that explore the pre-Nicene Eastern and Western traditions in detail. Revisiting the theology of baptism, this edition also provides more nuanced positions on the Eastern and Western traditions. Finally, recent liturgical developments in American Protestant churches, particularly Lutheran, as well as the ongoing development of the RCIA and confirmation practices of Catholics, made it necessary to revisit the place and meaning of these rites in the church today. Maxwell E. Johnson, PhD, is professor of liturgy at the University of Notre Dame and an ordained minister of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

The Bogomils A Study in Balkan Neo-Manichaeism,"Dimitri Obolensky, Dmitri Obolensky",Cambridge University Press,2004-08-19,"The Bogomils: A Study in Balkan Neo-Manichaeism traces the development of this little-understood heresy from its Middle Eastern roots. The Bogomils derived elements of their doctrine and practice from the Manichaeans and the Paulicians. By the reign of Alexius Comnenus, Bogomilism was rife within the Bulgarian and Byzantine empire and had taken hold even amongst influential families in Constantinople itself. Though they suffered persecution, decline and ultimate disappearance in their Balkan heartlands, the Bogomils were subsequently an influence upon more celebrated heresies in France and Italy. Dmitri Obolensky's magisterial study of Balkan dualism remains the definitive work on Bogomilism.",336,History,en,0521607639,paulicianism

The aim was to draw a large picture of the religious richness and complexity of the Seljuk and Ottoman worlds and to comment on the consequences in terms of heresies and syncretisms, two concepts which are currently revisited by the same token. The influence of the dualistic doctrinal legacy is particularly put in light.

The Rise of Bogomilism and Its Penetration Into Constantinople,John Sanidopoulos,,2011,"This study examines the penetration and dissolution of Bogomilism within the Late Eastern Roman Empire. It begins by examining the origins of Bogomilism through the various dualistic sects of the Middle East, Armenia and the Balkans, including those of Zoroastrianism, Manicheism, Gnosticism, Messalianism and Paulicianism, and moves forward in the examination of how Bogomilism emigrated from Bulgaria and Macedonia into the borders of the Roman Empire. Particular attention is paid to Basil the Bogomil, who together with his twelve disciples entered the capital of the Empire, Constantinople, during the reign of Emperor Alexios Komnenos (1056-1118 ad), and had great influence over both the rich and the poor. After the Emperor failed to persuade Basil to deny his heresy and accept Orthodoxy, he had him burned to death in front of numerous spectators in the Hippodrome. This eventually led to the official condemnation of Bogomilism by the Orthodox Church and the fleeing of adherents of Bogomilism to the West where they reestablished themselves. Some attention is given also to how Bogomilism has influenced contemporary trends and theology.After this complete examination, the book focuses on the first complete translation into English of Euthymios Zygabenos' Concerning Bogomilism contained in his Panoplia Dogmatiki (Dogmatic Panoply). This very important text was commissioned by Emperor Alexios, and consists of a complete doctrinal statement of the Bogomilism taught by Basil the Bogomil in Constantinople. This information was obtained by Zygabenos in an interview he conducted with Basil while he was imprisoned. This transcript is a valuable addition in the field of history, patrology, heresiology and church dogma.",161,Bogomiles,en,1933275596,bogomilism

The Hidden Tradition in Europe,Yuri Stoyanov,Penguin Mass Market,1994,"""Christianity has always defined itself through fierce opposition to powerful 'heresies'; yet it is only recently that we have begun to retrieve these remarkable, underground traditions, buried beneath the contempt of the Church."" ""Of these 'heresies' the greatest challenge to the medieval Church was posed by the 'Great Heresy' of the Cathars, who saw themselves as inheritors of a true and long-concealed Christian tradition, but who were also heirs to the age-long teachings of Dualism - the doctrine that cosmos and man are constant battlegrounds between the two principal and irreconcilably opposed forces of good and evil. The Cathars, who were savagely suppressed in the thirteenth century, are the best-known medieval adherents and martyrs of Dualism, but yet behind them we can still glimpse 'one of the most elusive and tenacious heretical sects of the Middle Ages' - the Balkan Bogomils."" ""In this superb piece of scholarly detective work Yuri Stoyanov charts the descent and evolution of Dualism, from the revelations of Zoroaster and the Orphics, via the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Mithraic Mysteries and the great Gnostic teachers, to reconstruct its medieval revival in Europe. His book casts fresh light on some of the most obscure aspects of the history and the teachings of the Bogomils and the Cathars and illuminates unsuspected religious and political undercurrents that lie beneath the surface of official history.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Scholars from a range of countries and disciplines explore current trends and everyday religiosity, particularly within the Armenian Apostolic Church (AAC), and amongst Armenian Catholics, Protestants and vernacular religions. Themes examined include: Armenian grass-roots religiosity; the changing forms of regular worship and devotion; various types of congregational life; and the dynamics of social composition of both the clergy and lay believers. Exploring through the lens of Armenia, this book considers wider implications of ’postsecular’ trends in the role of global religion.",286,Religion,en,9781317178576,tondrakians
"The Ottoman East in the Nineteenth Century Societies, Identities and Politics","Ali Sipahi, Dzovinar Derderian, Yasar Tolga Cora",Bloomsbury Publishing,2016-06-10,"The Ottoman East what is also called Western Armenia, Northern Kurdistan or Eastern Anatolia compared to other peripheries of the Ottoman Empire, has received very little attention in Ottoman historiography. So-called taboo subjects such as the fate of Ottoman Armenians and the Kurdish Question during the latter years of the Ottoman Empire have contributed to this dearth of analysis. By integrating the Armenian and Kurdish elements into the study of the Ottoman Empire, this book seeks to emphasise the interaction of different ethno-religious groups. As an area where Ottoman centralization faced unsurpassable challenges, the Ottoman East offers an ideal opportunity to examine an alternative social and political model for imperial governance and the means by which provincial rule interacted with the Ottoman centre. Discussing vital issues across this geographical area, such as trade routes, regional economic trends, migration patterns and the molding of local and national identities, this book offers a unique and fresh approach to the history and politics of modernization and empire in the wider region.""",346,History,en,9781786730343,tondrakians
Missions and Preaching Connected and Decompartmentalised Perspectives from the Middle East and North Africa (19th-21st Century),,BRILL,2022-09-12,"Based on a connected, relational and multidisciplinary approach (history, ethnography, political science, and theology), Mission and Preaching tackles the notion of mission through the analysis of preaching activities and religious dynamics across Christianity, Islam and Judaism, in the Middle East and North Africa, from the late 19th century until today. The 13 chapters reveal points of contact, exchange, and circulation, considering the MENA region as a central observatory. The volume offers a new chronology of the missionary phenomenon and calls for further cross-cutting approaches to decompartmentalise it, arguing that these approaches constitute useful entry points to shed new light on religious dynamics and social transformations in the MENA region.

The Caspian Post A landscape of high mountains and narrow valleys stretching from the Black to the Caspian Seas, the Caucasus region has been home to human populations for nearly 2 million years. In this richly illustrated 2-volume series, historian and explorer Christoph Baumer tells the story of the region's history through to the present day. It is a story of encounters between many different peoples, from Scythians, Turkic and Mongol peoples of the East to Greeks and Romans from the West, from Indo-European tribes from the West as well as the East, and to Arabs and Iranians from the South. It is a story of rival claims by Empires and nations and of how the region has become home to more than 50 languages that can be heard within its borders to this very day. This first volume charts the period from the emergence of the earliest human populations in the region – the first known human populations outside Africa - to the Seljuk conquests of 1050CE. Along the way the book charts the development of Neolithic, Iron and Bronze Age cultures, the first recognizable Caucasian state and the arrival of a succession of the great transnational Empires, from the Greeks, the Romans and the Armenian to competing Christian and Muslim conquerors. The History of the Caucasus: Volume 1 also includes more than 200 full colour images and maps bringing the changing cultures of these lands vividly to life.",394,History,en,9780755639694,tondrakians
The Political Economy of Human Rights in Armenia Authoritarianism and Democracy in a Former Soviet Republic,Simon Payaslian,Bloomsbury Publishing,2011-06-30,"Since its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia has experienced a reversal from democratization to a Soviet-style authoritarian regime and has been accused of repressive approaches to human rights. Here, Simon Payaslian juxtaposes a masterful survey of the history of the Armenian people from the nineteenth century through the first republic (1918-21) and Sovietization to the present, with the evolution of international human rights standards, and argues that a statist and authoritarian political culture has impeded political liberalization and institutionalization of human rights principles. Highlighting the clash between sovereignty on one side and human rights and democracy on the other, this comprehensive and in-depth analysis is essential for all those interested in human rights, democratization, political repression and the former Soviet republics.",430,History,en,9780857720054,tondrakians
Ararat Associations,Dick Tahta,"Germinal Productions, Limited/ Black Apollo Press",2006,"When he first saw Atom Egoyan's film, Ararat, Dick Tahta was intrigued by the many associations it summoned up for him. The film is crammed with brief conversations and scenes that linked with memories of his childhood in a small Armenian community in Manchester in the nineteen-thirties and with the various aspects of Armenian culture that are - as in any immigrant community - carefully nourished by Armenians all over the world. Above all, the film delicately raises the issue of what later generations have made of the terrible experiences of their ancestors in the last years of the Ottoman Empire. As well as giving a penetrating insight into Egoyan's film, Tahta offers some fascinating interpretations of Armenian history, religion, language and literature. His digressions into youthful memories, family history and his own travels through Eastern Anatolia, give this book a warm and personal feel. Dick Tahta was born in Manchester, of parents who had survived the events of 1915. They were keen for their children to have an English education but made sure that they spoke Armenian at home. As a second-generation immigrant, he was interested (like some of the characters in the film) in the nature of identity and its definition by criteria other than ethnicity. He raised four children with his late wife Hilary; he was a mathematics teacher and then a university lecturer. Now he is retired and is a widower and grandfather.",252,Biography & Autobiography,en,,tondrakians

Qanats are remarkably engineered underground aqueducts, using gravity to bring water to villages and towns where reliable flowing surface water is scarce or absent. Although an ancient technology, more than 46,000 of them still flow around the world today, with their sustainable nature making them a focus of renewed interest.

The Ladies' Repository,,,1872,"The idea of this women's magazine originated with Samuel Williams, a Cincinnati Methodist, who thought that Christian women needed a magazine less worldly than Godey's Lady's Book and Snowden's Lady's Companion. Written largely by ministers, this exceptionally well-printed little magazine contained well-written essays of a moral character, plenty of poetry, articles on historical and scientific matters, and book reviews. Among western writers were Alice Cary, who contributed over a hundred sketches and poems, her sister Phoebe Cary, Otway Curry, Moncure D. Conway, and Joshua R. Giddings; and New England contributors included Mrs. Lydia Sigourney, Hannah F. Gould, and Julia C.R Dorr. By 1851, each issue published a peice of music and two steel plates, usually landscapes or portraits. When Davis E. Clark took over the editorship in 1853, the magazine became brighter and attained a circulation of 40,000. Unlike his predecessors, Clark included fictional pieces and made the Repository a magazine for the whole family. After the war it began to decline and in 1876 was replaced by the National Repository. The Ladies' Repository was an excellent representative of the Methodist mind and heart. Its essays, sketches, and poems, its good steel engravings, and its moral tone gave it a charm all its own. -- Cf. American periodicals, 1741-1900.",1008,Women's periodicals,en,,lotharingia

The Historic King Arthur Authenticating the Celtic Hero of Post-Roman Britain,Frank D. Reno,McFarland,2007-03-20,"Who was King Arthur? How did the story originate? Through careful research of the many primary documents, a picture of the true Arthur can in fact be set down. He reached power shortly after the Romans evacuated Britain at the end of the fifth century and died at the Battle of Camlann. He became king at 15 under the name of Ambrosius Aurelianus and fought against the Saxons on the mainland as Riothamus, thus explaining the regeneration motif so closely tied to the mythical Arthur. This study reveals that the integrity and ideals central to Arthurian myth were very much a part of the real Arthur.",458,Biography & Autobiography,en,9780786430253,ambrosius aurelianus
Historic Figures of the Arthurian Era Authenticating the Enemies and Allies of Britain's Post-Roman King,Frank D. Reno,McFarland,2015-07-11,"The author has determined in an earlier McFarland book (The Historic King Arthur, 1996, paperback 2007) that there was not a historic King Arthur during the sixth century. However, as listed in The Historia Brittonum, there was a ""great king of all the kings of Britain"" named Ambrosius Aurelianus who was conflated with a heroic Arthur of the second century, and hence with the legendary King Arthur. To further authenticate the Celtic/Romano ""King Arthur,""--that is, Ambrosius--the author here examines seven major historical figures of the period A.D. 383-500 based upon the Genealogical Preface of The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the emendation of dates in that chronicle. Those seven allies and adversaries are Vortigern, Vortimer, Vitalinus, Cunedda, Cerdic, Octha, and Mordred. Through an extensive analysis of Arthur's 12 battles listed in the Historia Brittonum, this work explores both the influences of the High King's allies, and the shifting allegiances of his enemies. A battle list provides possible geographic locations for each of the battles, including a new site for Arthur's fateful battle at Camlann.",359,History,en,9780786492206,arthurian period
Handbook of Arthurian Romance King Arthur's Court in Medieval European Literature,"Leah Tether, Johnny McFadyen",Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG,2017-06-26,"The renowned and illustrious tales of King Arthur, his knights and the Round Table pervade all European vernaculars, as well as the Latin tradition. Arthurian narrative material, which had originally been transmitted in oral culture, began to be inscribed regularly in the twelfth century, developing from (pseudo-)historical beginnings in the Latin chronicles of ""historians"" such as Geoffrey of Monmouth into masterful literary works like the romances of Chrétien de Troyes. Evidently a big hit, Arthur found himself being swiftly translated, adapted and integrated into the literary traditions of almost every European vernacular during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. This Handbook seeks to showcase the European character of Arthurian romance both past and present. By working across national philological boundaries, which in the past have tended to segregate the study of Arthurian romance according to language, as well as by exploring primary texts from different vernaculars and the Latin tradition in conjunction with recent theoretical concepts and approaches, this Handbook brings together a pioneering and more complete view of the specifically European context of Arthurian romance, and promotes the more connected study of Arthurian literature across the entirety of its European context.",521,Literary Criticism,en,9783110432480,arthurian period

The Roman King Arthur? Lucius Artorius Castus,Tony Sullivan,Pen and Sword Military,2022-07-20,"The 2004 film, King Arthur, starring Clive Owen and Keira Knightley, introduced the audience to Lucius Artorius Castus as the basis to the much later legend of King Arthur. The book analyses the theories behind the film which link this second to third century Roman officer with the medieval Arthurian legends and a possible historical figure in post-Roman Britain. This first full academic study of Artorius Castus offers a number of potential timeframes and details his career through a turbulent and bloody period of Roman history, serving as primus pilus of V Macedonia and praefectus of the Sixth Legion in northern Britain. Turning to the historical narrative of the film it covers the archaeological and literary evidence for the break down of Roman Britain, arrival of Germanic peoples and emergence of petty kingdoms and new cultural identities. The penultimate chapter lays out the evidence for and against a historical Arthur, offering suggestions as to his identity, location of his battles and the possible political, military, social and cultural situation he lived and fought in. This is an entertaining and informative picture of two fascinating figures, one firmly historical, the other shrouded in myth and legend. The book leaves the reader with a clear picture of the lives of a Roman career officer and later dark-age warrior and the different worlds in which they lived. Anyone interested in the Roman period, post-Roman Britain and the possibilities for a historical Arthur should enjoy this book. “A fascinating investigation into the historical figure of Lucius Artorius Castus, camp prefect of VI Victrix based at Eboracum, York”. Dave Grainger, Legio VI Victrix, re-enactment group, York. “A welcome addition to modern discussions the roman army officer Lucius Artorius Castus which seeks to place him within an appropriate timescale and very properly disputes the links that have been suggested between this ‘real’ Roman army officer and the later and very much more fictional king Arthur”.

The Mammoth Book of King Arthur,Mike Ashley,Hachette UK,2011-09-01,"The most complete guide ever to the real Arthurian world and the legends that surround it He defeated the Saxons so decisively at the Battle of Badon that he held the Saxon invasion of Britain at bay for at least a generation. He has inspired more stories, books and films than any other historical or legendary figure. But who was the real King Arthur? Here is the most comprehensive guide to the real Arthurian world and the legends that surround and often obscure it. Sifting fact from fancy, Mike Ashley reveals the originals not only of King Arthur but also of Merlin. Guinevere, Lancelot and the knights of the Round Table - as well as all the major Arthurian sites. He traces each of the legends as they developed and brilliantly shows how they were later used to inspire major works of art, poetry, fiction and film. There is clear evidence that. The Arthurian legends arose from the exploits of not just one man, but at least three originating in Wales, Scotland and Brittany The true historical Arthur really existed and is distantly related to the present royal family The real Arthur and the real Merlin never knew each other The real Lancelot was not British but was closer to a sixth-century asylum-seeker The Holy Grail legend probably grew out of a cosmic catastrophe that could have destroyed most of civilization",514,Social Science,en,9781780333557,arthurian period
The Lost Tomb of King Arthur The Search for Camelot and the Isle of Avalon,Graham Phillips,Simon and Schuster,2016-04-11,"One man’s journey to uncover the final resting place of the historical King Arthur • Pinpoints the exact locations of Arthur’s tomb, the ruins of Camelot, and the sword Excalibur using literary research and the latest geophysics equipment • Examines previously unknown ancient manuscripts preserved in the vaults of the British Library--including one written within the living memory of Arthur’s time • Reveals the mythic king as the real-life leader Owain Ddantgwyn, who united the British to repel invasion from Germany around 500 AD One of the most enigmatic figures in world history, King Arthur has been the subject of many fantastical tales over the past 1500 years, leading many scholars to regard him and his fabled city of Camelot simply as myth. But, as Graham Phillips shows through a wealth of literary and scientific evidence, King Arthur was a real man, Camelot a real place, and the legendary Excalibur a real sword--and Phillips has located them all. Phillips examines the earliest stories of Arthur as well as previously unknown ancient manuscripts preserved in the vaults of the British Library in London, such as the work of the 9th-century monk Nennius, to pinpoint the exact locations of Arthur’s tomb, the ruins of Camelot, and the sword Excalibur. He reveals the mythic king as the real-life leader Owain Ddantgwyn, who united the British to repel invasion from Germany around 500 AD. Moving his quest from library vaults to the real sites of Arthur’s life, the author confirms his research through a Dark Age monument, hidden away in the mountains of western Britain, that bears an inscription about a powerful warlord who went by the battle title “Arthur.” He visits archaeological excavations at the ruins of Viroconium, near Wroxeter in Shropshire, clearly identifying the ancient city as Camelot, the fortified capital of Arthur’s Britain. Working with specialist divers and marine archaeologists, he surveys the depths of an ancient lake in the English countryside to reveal the resting place of Excalibur. Enlisting a team of scientists and sophisticated geophysics equipment, he uncovers the lost grave of the historical King Arthur, buried with his shield, just as told in legend. The culmination of 25 years of research, including new translations of primary source material, this book provides the necessary evidence to allow King Arthur to finally be accepted as the authentic British king he was.",412,"Body, Mind & Spirit",en,9781591437581,arthurian period

His glory, however, would be short-lived. For even as he drew the sword from the stone, a doom settled over Arthur that would see his kingdom fall to betrayal and war. In this book, Daniel Mersey retells the great stories of Arthur, from his winning of Excalibur and his marriage to Guinevere, through his battle with the giant in France and his war against the army of Rome to the treachery of Mordred and his death at Camlann. Supporting this narrative is an exploration of the different facets of Arthurian myth, including the numerous conflicting theories of his historical origin, the tales of Welsh folklore and Medieval romance, and even his various portrayals in the modern media.

The Quest for King Arthur,James Frost,Trafford Publishing,2010-06-30,"The debate over King Arthur is one of the oldest on record. But up until now all attempts to settle the debate have centred on interpretations of the documentation. But documents, as important as they are, are not the only tools at our disposal. History repeats itself. One of the reasons it does this is that there are a surprisingly large number of things that can only happen one way. Furthermore different societies do certain things in specific ways. Once it is known how these things work, then no documentation is necessary to explain what happened. There is enough information to determine the basic political and military systems the Britons used. It then becomes a matter of using this information to explain what is known of the course of the wars of this period to determine whether or not there is reason to believe that any such hero existed. But the system has other uses as well. Legends also work in specific ways. This technique can also be used to trace the origin of many of the figures and events in the legends.",290,Philosophy,en,9781426903540,arthurian period
King Arthur The Truth Behind the Legend,Rodney Castleden,Routledge,2003-03-13,"King Arthur is often written off as a medieval fantasy, the dream of those yearning for an age of strong, just rulers and a contented kingdom. Those who accept his existence at all generally discard the stories that surround him. This exciting new investigation argues not only that Arthur did exist, as a Dark Age chieftain, but that many of the romantic tales - of Merlin, Camelot and Excalibur - are rooted in truth. In his quest for the real King Arthur, Rodney Castleden uses up-to-date archaeological and documentary evidence to recreate the history and society of Dark Age Britain and its kings. He revives the possibility that Tintagel was an Arthurian legend, and proposes a radical new theory - that Arthur escaped alive from his final battle. A location is even suggested for perhaps the greatest mystery, the whereabouts of Arthur's grave. King Arthur: The Truth Behind the Legend offers a more complete picture of Arthur's Britain and his place in it than ever before.

The Blood of Avalon The Secret History of the Grail Dynasty from King Arthur to Prince William,Adrian Gilbert,Watkins Media Limited,2013-12-12,"The story of King Arthur and the quest for the Holy Grail is well known; less so is that of the coming of Christianity to Britain at around the time of the Roman invasion. It is generally assumed that both these legends revolve around town of Glastonbury, yet the paucity of evidence for this assumption has always been troubling to those who like their history to be founded on fact. In this extraordinary book, Adrian Gilbert reveals the location to be not just of the true 'Avalon' or 'Glastonbury' but of many other sites crucial to the Arthurian legend. He shows how the core teachings of Christianity were kept secret by a dynasty of Welsh kings and saints and later (after the Norman invasions) by their surviving descendants. For centuries this remnant of the Brittano-Welsh nobility, still living in 'Avalon', kept alive a hope: they prayed that one day a new Arthur, one with the holy blood of the family of Mary flowing in his veins, would sit once more on the throne of Britain. Extraordinary as it may seem, this hope may soon be realised - for through the late Diana, Princess of Wales, our own Prince William, whose middle name is indeed Arthur, is so descended.",321,"Body, Mind & Spirit",en,9781780286280,arthurian period
"The Complete King Arthur Many Faces, One Hero","John Matthews, Caitlín Matthews",Simon and Schuster,2017-04-24,"A comprehensive examination of the historical and mythological evidence for every major theory about King Arthur • Explores the history of every Arthur candidate and the geographical arguments that have placed him in different locations • Examines 1,800 years of evidence for Arthur’s life and the famous series of 12 battles fought against the Saxons in the 6th century • Reconstructs the history of the 6th century in Britain, when the first references to Arthur and the core events of his reign appear Few legends have had the enduring influence of those surrounding King Arthur. Many believe the stories are based on historical truth. For others Arthur represents the archetype of the brilliant monarch reigning over a fairy-tale kingdom, offering his knights the opportunity to prove their mettle in battle and find gnostic illumination through initiation into sacred mysteries like that of the Grail. Presenting the culmination of more than 40 years’ research, John and Caitlín Matthews examine the historical and mythological evidence for every major theory about the existence of King Arthur. Drawing on modern techniques in archaeology and scholarship, they reconstruct the history of the 6th century in Britain, the period when the first unambiguous references to Arthur appear. They explore the history of every Arthur candidate, the geographical arguments that have placed him in different locations, and the evidence for his life and famous battles fought against the Saxons. Was the greatest British hero of all time not a king but a 2nd-century Roman officer active around Hadrian’s Wall in Cumbria? A 5th-century soldier who operated in areas as far apart as Cornwall, Wales, Scotland, or Brittany? Or an entirely mythical fiction that provided a figure of light during a dark period of British history? Examining other literary figures from the 5th century such as Vortigern and Ambrosius, the authors also break down the plots of all the major Arthurian romances, including those by Chretien de Troyes, Sir Thomas Malory, and Robert de Boron, to reveal the historical events they are based on. Piecing together the many fragments that constitute the image of Arthur, both the man and the myth, the authors show how each face of Arthur has something to offer and how his modern popularity proves the enduring power of the hero-myth, truly earning Arthur the title he first received in the 15th century: The Once and Future King.",367,"Body, Mind & Spirit",en,9781620556009,arthurian period

"Revealing King Arthur Swords, Stones and Digging for Camelot",Christopher Gidlow,The History Press,2011-11-08,"Arthur: mythical hero, legendary king. But was he, as the legends claimed, an actual Dark-Age Briton? From Glastonbury and Tintagel to the supposed sites of Arthur's Camelot and his famous battles, this book investigates how archaeologists have interpreted the evidence. Might new discoveries and the latest theories finally reveal the real King Arthur? For 800 years the controversy over Arthur's existence has ebbed and flowed. Rusty swords, imposing ruins, the Round Table, even Arthur's body itself were offered as proof that he had once reigned over Britain. The quest was revived by the scientific archaeologists of the 1960s. Just as Greek legends had led to the discovery of Troy, so might the romances lead to Camelot. This optimism did not last. Sceptics poured scorn on the obscure manuscripts and strong imagination on which the questers relied. For 30 years academics closed ranks against King Arthur. The discovery at Tintagel of a mysterious slate, inscribed with names from the Arthurian legends, shook this scepticism to its roots. Was it a clue at last? This book argues that it is time to reassess the possibility of a real King Arthur and acknowledge the importance his legends still hold for us today.",383,History,en,9780752476384,arthurian period
King Arthur and Robin Hood The History and Folklore of England’s Most Famous Folk Legends,"Charles River Editors,",Charles River Editors,2025-05-01,"King Arthur is one of the most famous names in history, and his name still evokes visions of fantasy, chivalry, bravery, and more even today. Arthur remains a pop culture fixture around the globe, made famous in various Arthurian tales written by writers like Chretien de Troyes. Arthur came to embody the ideals of the Middle Ages: strength, chivalry, bravery, and more. Along the way, his Excalibur sword, the Holy Grail, his queen, and more have all become household words. Arthur has long been identified as a folk hero, and there are countless tales that comprise the Arthurian legend, but was there an actual person that the original stories were based on? People still search for the seeds of truth in the Knights of the Round Table, and the historical figure that inspired the Arthurian tales. Of course, as with all great myths, and even those with a kernel of truth behind them, there is no ""real"" Arthur. Arthur is now comprised of the works written by diverse storytellers, most of which have built upon the ancient stories and possibly history. It is from there that a primordial seed of myth remains at the heart of all the retellings. At the same time, Arthur’s story is one of transformation, as he is brought from the Middle Ages into the Renaissance and more modern times. And that story also includes the famous contemporaries in his stories and other important historical figures, like Geoffrey of Monmouth, the imprisoned Sir Thomas Mallory and Walt Disney. When looking for the historical and mythical Arthur, scholars try to understand how the Arthur of these tales and of others like Disney's Sword in the Stone and Monty Python and the Holy Grail came to be. What are the origins of the Arthur legend and what can they tell people about the past? What is the historical basis for King Arthur, if any? There are few characters in the English language more iconic than Robin Hood. Emerging out of the ballads of the High Middle Ages and surviving through numerous permutations to the present day, the green-clad archer has become an icon. Today he represents a playful, irreverent and cunning resistance to corruption and injustice, associated primarily with stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Robin Hood’s selfless acts of helping the masses at the expense of himself (by not keeping his treasure) have led to contemporary figures like Bill Gates being called “Modern Day Robin Hoods”, and when a British man robbed a bank in 2013 and handed out the money to homeless people before he was arrested and imprisoned, the name Robin Hood was naturally in the news once more. Robin Hood is a celebrated folk hero and a kind of good thief, but the earliest stories about Robin Hood depict a far different character. The first Robin Hood was often a brutal and selfish yet also honorable figure, an anti-hero loved (perhaps paradoxically) by many social classes and loathed by authorities. When the notorious Gunpowder Plot was discovered at the beginning of the 17th century, the Earl of Salisbury condemned Guy Fawkes and the conspirators for being “Robin Hoods”. The transformation of Robin Hood over the centuries has left many scholars attempting to find the origins behind the original story. Like King Arthur, some have even sought a historical figure that might serve as the basis for Robin Hood, while others have sought out mythological origins to see if Robin Hood’s character evolved out of a mythological figure. When looking for the historical and mythical figure, scholars try to understand how the Robin Hood of these tales and came to be.

The Origin Legends of Early Medieval Britain and Ireland,Lindy Brady,Cambridge University Press,2022-08-04,"The inhabitants of early medieval Britain and Ireland shared the knowledge that the region held four peoples and the awareness that they must have originally come from 'elsewhere'. The Origin Legends of Early Medieval Britain and Ireland studies these peoples' origin stories, an important genre that has shaped national identity and collective history from the early medieval period to the present day. These multilingual texts share many common features that repay their study as a genre, but have previously been isolated as four disparate traditions and used to argue for the long roots of current nationalisms. Yet they were not written or read in isolation during the medieval period. Individual narratives were in constant development, written and rewritten to respond to other texts.

On the Ruin of Britain De Excidio Britanniae,Gildas,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-03-10,"On the Ruin of Britain: De Excidio Britanniae by Gildas. De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (Latin for ""On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain"", sometimes just ""On the Ruin of Britain"") is a work by the 6th-century AD British cleric St Gildas. It is a sermon in three parts condemning the acts of Gildas' contemporaries, both secular and religious, whom he blames for the dire state of affairs in sub-Roman Britain. It is one of the most important sources for the history of Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries, as it is the only significant source for the period written by a near contemporary of the people and events described. Part I contains a narrative of British history from the Roman conquest to Gildas' time; it includes references to Ambrosius Aurelianus and the Britons' victory against the Saxons at the Battle of Mons Badonicus. Part II is a condemnation of five kings for their various sins, including both obscure figures and relatively well-documented ones such as Maelgwn Gwynedd. Part III is a similar attack upon the British clergy of the age.",0,History,en,1986330575,de excidio et conquestu britanniae
"Strategies of Identity Construction The Writings of Gildas, Aneirin and Bede",Stefan J. Schustereder,V&R Unipress,2015-09-16,"Based on an analysis of a variety of early medieval writings from Britain, including De Excidio et Conquestu Brittaniae by the Briton Gildas, the early Welsh collection of stanzas commonly referred to as Y Gododdin, and the Venerable Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, his Historia Abbatum and Chronica Maior, Strategies of Identity Construction provides evidence of an active and productive medieval discourse of ethnic and political identity construction in Britain. The book demonstrates that different gentes, even competing peoples, use the same strategies to construct and communicate their identities. This phenomenon is not only visible when comparing the different writings which were subject to analysis in this research, but can also be seen when analyzing changes the writings underwent during the transmission processes of their manuscripts throughout the Middle Ages. Elements of a discourse of identity construction here not only appear to be productive, but can also be seen in close connection with historical, political and social developments at the same time, rendering the study of the discourse of identity construction an important tool for providing a modern understanding of medieval politics and societies in periods of change and transition.",282,History,en,9783847004318,de excidio et conquestu britanniae
"Manuscripts, Market and the Transition to Print in Late Medieval Brittany",Diane E. Booton,Routledge,2016-12-05,"Manuscripts, Market and the Transition to Print in Late Medieval Brittany surveys the production and marketing of non-monastic manuscripts and printed books over 150 years in late medieval Brittany, from the accession of the Montfort family to the ducal crown in 1364 to the duchy's formal assimilation by France in 1532. Brittany, as elsewhere, experienced the shift of manuscript production from monasteries to lay scriptoria and from rural settings to urban centers, as the motivation for copying the word in ink on parchment evolved from divine meditation to personal profit. Through her analysis of the physical aspects of Breton manuscripts and books, parchment and paper, textual layouts, scripts and typography, illumination and illustration, Diane Booton exposes previously unexplored connections between the tangible cultural artifacts and the society that produced, acquired and valued them. Innovatively, Booton's discussion incorporates archival research into the prices, wages and commissions associated with the manufacture of the works under discussion to shed new light on their economic and personal value.",573,Literary Criticism,en,9781351920025,medieval brittany
Brittany in the Early Middle Ages Texts and Societies,Wendy Davies,Taylor & Francis,2023-05-31,"This volume focuses on Wendy Davies's work on early medieval Breton texts and their implications. Beginning with core analyses of the Redon and Landévennec cartularies, it continues with papers that tease out some of the key social implications of the 9th-century Redon material - on the nature of political power, on rural communities, on the settlement of disputes, and on transmission of property. While the Redon charters have long been known as a source of fundamental importance for Breton history, the author's database (established in the 1980s) allowed much greater understanding of the role of individuals - at all social levels, and particularly peasant level - than had previously been possible. Attention to the detail of the east Breton past also includes papers on some of the results of her fieldwork, on building stone in particular. Early medieval Brittany is not merely interesting in itself (and it is certainly not some Celtic backwater): Breton evidence can usefully be differentiated from the evidence of other Celtic areas and has a significant role in wider issues of European history. As well as papers on the familiar themes of kingship, rulership, cult sites and cemeteries, the final section highlights the distinctive quality of the Breton evidence for the protection of sacred and personal space, for slavery and serfdom and for village-level courts.",379,History,en,9781000950885,medieval brittany
"Between France and England Politics, Power and Society in Late Medieval Brittany",Michael Jones,Taylor & Francis,2024-10-28,"'Between France and England' characterises the role played by most rulers of the duchy of Brittany during the late Middle Ages, before it was finally united with Valois France. These essays (including three appearing for the first time in English) explore political and institutional aspects of the changing relationship between France and Brittany, within the context of Anglo-French relations, as well as social consequences of the development of a largely autonomous state within the larger French kingdom during a period dominated by war and economic crisis. The transformation of medieval France into an early modern state changed the traditional relationship between the king and his great feudal princes. But some princes reacted by imitating the crown, creating their own more advanced administrations and an ideological base for claims to exercise 'regal rights' within their lordships, often expressed in striking visual and symbolic form. These trends are evident in the late medieval duchy of Brittany where the Montfort dynasty all but succeeded in nullifying royal control.",326,History,en,9781040246481,medieval brittany

"Multi-disciplinary Approaches to Medieval Brittany, 450-1200 Connections and Disconnections","Caroline Brett, Paul Russell, Fiona Edmonds",Brepols Publishers,2023,"While it is well-established that Brittany and the Insular world were closely linked during the medieval period, the precise nature of these connections continues to spark debate. Was there a significant migration in the fifth century, or were the connections more multi-faceted and enduring than medieval accounts suggest? And how might we triangulate the Atlantic connections with other influences on medieval Brittany, including those from the Carolingian world? Drawing together research that was first presented at the conference 'Brittany and the Atlantic Archipelago: Contact, Myth and History 450-1200', held in Cambridge in December 2017, this volume seeks to present new and ground-breaking research into both Brittany and its broader European context during the medieval period.

Britons and Anglo-Saxons in the Early Middle Ages,D. N. Dumville,Variorum Publishing,1993,"The principal issue with which these essays are concerned is the nature of relations between the English and the British in the period from the collapse of Roman authority in Britain to the end of the first Viking-Age. As in the previous collection, Histories and Pseudo-Histories of the Insular Middle Ages, Dr Dumville emphasises the central importance of close study of manuscripts and texts as the key to understanding the early history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms and the 9th-to 13th-century perceptions of these. Among the studies, several deal with the historical evaluation of Beowulf and other works of Old English and Welsh literature; others illustrate the need to include the Britons across the Channel, in Brittany, in any full consideration of Insular culture.La question principale à laquelle ces essais se rattachent est celle de la nature des rapports entre les Anglais et les Britanniques autochtones durant la période allant de la chute de l'autorité romaine en Grande-Bretagne jusqu'à la fin du premier âge viking. Ainsi qu'il l'avait déjà fait dans une collection précédente, Histories and Pseudo-Histories of the Insular Middle Ages le Dr Dumville souligne la prime importance d'une étude minutieuse des textes manuscrits en tant qu'éléments clef dans la compréhension du début de l'histoire des royaumes anglo-saxons et de la perception qu'on en avait entre le 9e et le 13e siècle. Parmi les études, plusieures traitent de l'évaluation historique de travaux provenant de la littérature galloise et anglaise ancienne, notamment de Beowulf; d'autres font état du besoin d'inclure les Britanniques établis de l'autre côté de la Manche, en Bretagne, dans toute considération de la culture insulaire se voulant complète.",360,History,en,,medieval brittany

The Emergence of the Bohemian State,Petr Charvát,BRILL,2010-09-10,"The emergence of the Bohemian state is a long-discussed topic with many obscure points. Though significant progress has been reached in recent decades, the interpretations proposed are far from satisfactory. Important new information is still awaiting inclusion in explanatory schemes. In addition to that, treatises on the origins of Bohemian state have frequently failed to take account of studies of scholars from abroad. Taking account of all this, the author proposes a fresh look on some of the essential data provided by history, archaeology, art history and cultural or social anthropology. What emerges is a nuanced perspective of the rising of one of central Europe ́s first states, attempting to avoid the pitfalls to which traditional research has been falling, with emphasis on a broad scope of vision taking account of research results reached far and wide.",266,History,en,9789047444596,marcomanni
An Analysis of Marcus Aurelius's Meditations,James Orr,Taylor & Francis,2017-07-28,"Despite being written between 170 and 180, Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations often resonates with modern readers because of its remarkable resemblance to a self-help book. Written as a series of personal notes in the last decade of his reign as Roman emperor, the meditations were never intended for circulation. But they remain today among the classics of stoic philosophy – and as exquisite examples of problem-solving. Meditations sees a great leader engaged in solving one of the central problems of all philosophy: how to live a good life. Marcus Aurelius is quick to ask questions and generate solutions, all of which lead him to a greater understanding of what a good life really is. He makes the decision that philosophy is an important tool we can use every day to help us understand and deal with the world. The best way to get to the bottom of a problem, he records, is to analyze its different aspects with care – this will help to ‘dissolve’ the issue. To keep our minds well balanced, it is vital to keep our desire for the material and the sensual in check to avoid falling prey to negative behaviors like jealousy, quarrelling and indulgence. Philosophy, the Meditations show, can also help us to understand other people’s problems and difficulties – acting as a continual spur to the consideration and resolution of problems, wherever they arise.",91,Literary Criticism,en,9781351253789,marcus aurelius
Marcus Aurelius in Love Marcus Aurelius & Marcus Cornelius Fronto,"Marcus Aurelius, Marcus Cornelius Fronto",University of Chicago Press,2016-02-19,"In 1815 a manuscript containing one of the long-lost treasures of antiquity was discovered—the letters of Marcus Cornelius Fronto, reputed to have been one of the greatest Roman orators. But this find disappointed many nineteenth-century readers, who had hoped for the letters to convey all of the political drama of Cicero’s. That the collection included passionate love letters between Fronto and the future emperor Marcus Aurelius was politely ignored—or concealed. And for almost two hundred years these letters have lain hidden in plain sight. Marcus Aurelius in Love rescues these letters from obscurity and returns them to the public eye. The story of Marcus and Fronto began in 139 CE, when Fronto was selected to instruct Marcus in rhetoric. Marcus was eighteen then and by all appearances the pupil and teacher fell in love. Spanning the years in which the relationship flowered and died, these are the only love letters to survive from antiquity—homoerotic or otherwise. With a translation that reproduces the effusive, slangy style of the young prince and the rhetorical flourishes of his master, the letters between Marcus and Fronto will rightfully be reconsidered as key documents in the study of the history of sexuality and classics.",181,Biography & Autobiography,en,9780226378114,marcus aurelius

Marcus Aurelius,John Sellars,Routledge,2020-07-02,"In this new study, John Sellars offers a fresh examination of Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations as a work of philosophy by placing it against the background of the tradition of Stoic philosophy to which Marcus was committed. The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is a perennial bestseller, attracting countless readers drawn to its unique mix of philosophical reflection and practical advice. The emperor is usually placed alongside Seneca and Epictetus as one of three great Roman Stoic authors, but he wears his philosophy lightly, not feeling the need to state explicitly the ideas standing behind the reflections that he was writing for himself. As a consequence, his standing as a philosopher has often been questioned. Challenging claims that Marcus Aurelius was merely an eclectic thinker, that the Meditations do not fit the model of a work of philosophy, that there are no arguments in the work, and that it only contains superficial moral advice, Sellars shows that he was in constant dialogue with his Stoic predecessors, engaging with themes drawn from all three parts of Stoicism: logic, physics, and ethics. The image of Marcus Aurelius that emerges is of a committed Stoic, engaging with a wide range of philosophical topics, motivated by the desire to live a good life. This volume will be of interest to scholars and students of both Classics and Philosophy.",283,Biography & Autobiography,en,9780429627965,marcus aurelius

Military History of Late Rome 425–457,Ilkka Syvänne,Pen and Sword Military,2021-10-01,"A history of pivotal military and political events in Ancient Rome from 425 to 457 BC. Military History of Late Rome 425–457 analyses in great detail how the Romans coped with the challenge posed by masses of Huns in a situation in which the Germanic tribes had gained a permanent foothold in the territories of West Rome. This analysis reassesses the strategy and tactics of the period. The book shows how cooperation between the West Roman Master of Soldiers, Aetius, and East Roman Emperor Marcian saved Western civilization from the barbarian nightmare posed by the Huns of Attila. A fresh appraisal of the great clash at the Catalaunian Fields in 451 offers new insights into the mechanics of the fighting and shows that it was a true battle of nations which decided nothing less than the fate of human civilization. Had Aetius and his allies lost the battle and had Marcian not cooperated with Aetius in 451 and 452, we would not have seen the rise of the West and the rise of the scientific thinking. Praise for Military History of Late Rome 425–457 ""An outstanding work . . . [the series] gives us a very good picture of the long process that has come to be known as the ""Fall of Rome"".

The Past is Prologue The Revolution of Nicene Historiography,Thomas C. Ferguson,BRILL,2005-08-01,"While there has been substantial scholarly work done on the development of Christian doctrine in the fourth and fifth centuries, very little corresponding attention has been paid to the writing of church history during this critical period. This work examines how authors began to construct the historical narrative of the “Arian” controversy and focuses on the interplay between theology and worshipping communities. Major figures such as Eusebius and Athanasius are examined, and important but overlooked figures such as an anonymous non-Nicene chronicler and Philostorgius are also included. In the introduction the book surveys recent developments in the study of “Arianism” and discusses the usefulness of the very category of an “Arian controversy.” Subsequent chapters set forth the thesis that church histories are important sources for understanding the development of doctrine. A chapter is devoted to Eusebius’ Ecclesiastical History, especially the oft-overlooked Book X. Further chapters explore the role of Rufinus as the first extant author to write a continuation of Eusebius. The work also consciously includes marginalized non-Nicene sources, and there are chapters which examine an anonymous non-Nicene chronicler and the Ecclesiastical History of the Eunomian Philostorgius of Borissus. The book is particularly useful for persons interested in examining the development of doctrine in the fourth century from fresh perspectives. The work approaches church histories as narrative myths of community origins produced by worshipping communities standing in continuity to local schools of thought.",240,Religion,en,9789047407836,aetius
Empress Galla Placidia and the Fall of the Roman Empire,Kenneth Atkinson,McFarland,2020-05-12,"Despite her status as one of history's most important women, the story of Galla Placidia's life has been largely forgotten. Though the Roman empress witnessed the decline and fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century and lived a life of almost constant suffering, her actions helped postpone the fall of Rome and had massive, widespread impact on the empire that can still be felt today. She watched the barbarian king Alaric and his horde of Visigoth warriors sack Rome, slaughter many of the city's inhabitants, and take her hostage. Surviving captivity, Galla Placidia became the queen of the barbarians who had imprisoned her. Eventually, she became the only woman to rule the Roman empire alone. Soldiers obeyed her commands while Popes and Christian saints alike sought her advice. Despite all obstacles and likely suffering from what we now know as PTSD, she lived to an old age by the standards of the time. This book uses the letters and writings of Galla Placidia's contemporaries to reconstruct, in more depth and detail than has previously been attempted, the remarkable story of her life and the decline and fall of the Roman Empire.",223,Biography & Autobiography,en,9781476639857,aetius
Defending Rome: The Masters of the Soldiers,Julian Reynolds,Xlibris Corporation,2011-06-25,"For its last eighty years, the Western Roman Empire was ruled by emperors who were unable to provide the leadership demanded by the crisis the Empire faced throughout this period. Power was exercised instead by the commanders of the Western armies, the magisteri militum or Masters of the Soldiers, four of whom stood out – Stilicho, Constantius, Aetius and Ricimer. Challenged by barbarian invasions, constantly diminishing resources, and indifference and sometimes hostility from the imperial court, the Senate and the Roman people, these men prolonged the existence of the Empire in the West beyond what would otherwise have been its natural span. This book tells the story of the collapse of the Western Empire, as seen through the lives of these individuals, a collapse that ended more than political and military structures, that encompassed the end of an ancient pagan culture and the inception of the age of Christianity.",255,History,en,9781477164600,aetius

Bilingualism and the Latin Language,J. N. Adams,Cambridge University Press,2003-01-09,"Since the 1980s, bilingualism has become one of the main themes of sociolinguistics - but there are as yet few large-scale treatments of the subject specific to the ancient world. This book is the first work to deal systematically with bilingualism during a period of antiquity (the Roman period, down to about the fourth century AD) in the light of sociolinguistic discussions of bilingual issues. The general theme of the work is the nature of the contact between Latin and numerous other languages spoken in the Roman world. Among the many issues discussed three are prominent: code-switching (the practice of switching between two languages in the course of a single utterance) and its motivation, language contact as a cause of change in one or both of the languages in contact, and the part played by language choice and language switching in the establishment of personal and group identities.",876,Foreign Language Study,en,0521817714,syagrius
The Imperial Families of Ancient Rome,Maxwell Craven,Fonthill Media,2019-12-08,"The Roman Empire was a spectacular polity of unprecedented scale which stretched from Scotland to Sudan and from Portugal to Persia. It survived for over 500 years in the west and 1,480 years in the east. Ruling it was a task of frightening complexity; few emperors made a good fist of it, yet thanks to dynastic connections, an efficient bureaucracy and a governing class eager to attain the kudos of holding the highest offices, it survived the mad, bad and incompetent emperors remarkably well. Although not always apparent, it was the interplay of emperors' kin and family connections which also made a major contribution to controlling the empire. This book aims to put on record the known ancestry, relations and descendants of all emperors, including ephemeral ones and show connections from one dynasty to another as completely as possible, accompanied by concise biographical notes about each ruler and known facts about family members, which include Romans both famous and obscure. It also attempts to distinguish between certainty and possibility and to eliminate obvious fiction. The introduction provides a narrative lead-in to the creation of the empire, attempts to clarify the complexities of Roman genealogy and assess the sources.",748,History,en,,syagrius
Dressing Judeans and Christians in Antiquity,"Kristi Upson-Saia, Carly Daniel-Hughes, Alicia J. Batten",Routledge,2016-05-13,"The past two decades have witnessed a proliferation of scholarship on dress in the ancient world. These recent studies have established the extent to which Greece and Rome were vestimentary cultures, and they have demonstrated the critical role dress played in communicating individuals’ identities, status, and authority. Despite this emerging interest in ancient dress, little work has been done to understand religious aspects and uses of dress. This volume aims to fill this gap by examining a diverse range of religious sources, including literature, art, performance, coinage, economic markets, and memories. Employing theoretical frames from a range of disciplines, contributors to the volume demonstrate how dress developed as a topos within Judean and Christian rhetoric, symbolism, and performance from the first century BCE to the fifth century CE. Specifically, they demonstrate how religious meanings were entangled with other social logics, revealing the many layers of meaning attached to ancient dress, as well as the extent to which dress was implicated in numerous domains of ancient religious life.",320,History,en,9781317147978,syagrius

Empire in Anarchy The Crisis of the Third Century and Reign of Aurelian,Joshua Howell,,2019,"Throughout much of the 3rd century in the Roman empire, the empire itself teetered on the brink of collapse. Social, economic and military pressures pushed the empire to its limits, with many of these problems surviving in one form or another beyond the reign of Constantine. Many historians have begun to contest the notion of the existence of a crisis century, merely stating that Rome was in a perpetual decline in one form or another, or to put it simply; all of Rome’s existence was a Crisis-era. However, despite this prevailing attitude, Rome did in fact suffer through tremendous hardship during the early to late 3rd century, with the actions of several would be military usurpers and long lines of unfit emperors leading the empire further onto the brink of dissolution. Until one emperor found wild success and managed to instill a panoply of economic, social, religious, and military reforms that gave the empire hundreds of years of life.",0,,en,,crisis of third century

Only on the cusp of the Middle Ages did the town's residents entrench themselves in a smaller settlement outside the walls.

Rome in the Third Century A Troubled Empire,Michael Sage,Pen and Sword Military,2025-01-31,"An in-depth exploration of Rome's third-century crisis, examining its internal turmoil, external pressures, and transformative reforms. For its first two centuries the Roman Empire enjoyed a relatively peaceful existence. There were short periods of trouble and instability, but they had no lasting effect. At the end of the second century AD, the situation began to change and by the third century the Empire was beset by serious internal and external threats. Rome in the Third Century examines this time of troubles. Michael Sage begins by analyzing the available sources, which are difficult to use and provide mostly fragmentary glimpses of the period and looks at the surprising disappearance of historical writing in the western half of the empire. He then discusses in detail the increasing pressures on Rome’s northern and eastern frontiers, along with the growing internal threats that the empire faced as the state weakened and experienced increasing internal disintegration. He then narrates the period between the death of the emperor Septimius Severus in 211 and the accession of the emperor Diocletian at the end of the century, when a reformed empire emerged, in many respects very different from its predecessor. The crucial changes in government and the military of this period are explained and assessed and there is a new analysis of contemporary views, both Christian and pagan, of the crisis.",226,History,en,9781399063166,crisis of third century
The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine,Patricia Southern,Routledge,2003-12-16,"The third century AD in the Roman Empire began and ended with Emperors who are recognised today as being strong and dynamic - Septimius Severus, Diocletian and Constantine. Yet the intervening years have traditionally been seen as a period of crisis. The 260s saw the nadir of Imperial fortunes, with every frontier threatened or overrun, the senior emperor imprisoned by the Persians, and Gaul and Palmyra breaking away from central control. It might have been thought that the empire should have collapsed - yet it did not. Pat Southern shows how this was possible by providing a chronological history of the Empire from the end of the second century to the beginning of the fourth; the emergence and devastating activities of the Germanic tribes and the Persian Empire are analysed, and a conclusion details the economic, military and social aspects of the third century 'crisis'.",840,History,en,9781134553808,crisis of third century
Rome's Imperial Crisis: The History of the Roman Empire in the 3rd Century After Severus Alexander's Assassination,Charles River Editors,Independently Published,2019-02-14,"*Includes pictures *Includes online resources and a bibliography for further reading The 50 years following the assassination of Severus Alexander on March 19, 235 CE has been generally regarded by academics as one of the lowest points in the history of the Roman Empire. This stands in stark contrast to the previous 150 years, which included the reigns of the Five Good Emperors and has been universally praised as one of the high points of the empire. Severus Alexander was the last of the Severan emperors, and the subsequent years of crisis (235-285 CE) were characterized by a series of short reigns, usually ending in the violent death of the reigning emperor. At the same time, this period of time also saw the empire beset by threatening forces on all sides. The Romans faced a newly resurgent Persia in the east, as well as significant forces from German tribes on the Rhine and Goths along the Danube. The various conflicts would result in the unprecedented death of a sitting emperor in battle, which took place in 251 with Emperor Decius, and Emperor Valerian was captured in 260 CE. Despite the disasters, there was at least some good news for the Romans. Aurelian and Probus both managed to recover lost territory, and they recovered some of Rome's prestige in doing so. The final turning point came with the accession of Diocletian in 284 CE. From that point on, the empire embarked upon a period of restoration, but before reaching that stage, the empire had no fewer than 20 emperors in those 50 years, even with the exclusion of an additional five Gallic ""emperors"" who set themselves up as independent rulers between 260 and 274 CE. Diocletian's reign would see reforms put into place to achieve the desired end of the Imperial Crisis, and several of the emperors before him may well have had the ability to manage the reform process, but the army's power and willingness to use and abuse power ensured that few of them truly had a chance to really make their marks. It was the worst period in the history of the Roman Empire to that point, even as it forced the Romans to deal with belligerent foreign powers and problems created by the emergence of increasingly powerful and populous provinces. The pressures created by population growth, both within the empire and outside of it, have been thoroughly researched, but more recently, issues created by climate change have also commanded attention. The previously held assumption was that population increases in modern Germany and further east pushed hostile groups into Roman territory, and it is now believed that in the 2nd century CE, climate change led to significant rises in sea levels that caused massive flooding and the destruction of crops in Eastern Europe. This may have given people the impetus to migrate south and west, at the very time Rome was focused on containing the Sassanid Persian Empire. It is often overlooked that the Persian Empire was every bit as large as that of the Romans and equally well developed militarily during this period, which explains the difficulty Rome had in their relations. As Roman leaders vied with each other for power and constantly fought civil wars, Rome's famous roads fall into disrepair, the economy was crippled, the continent-wide trade system that had flourished in the previous years was replaced with a basic barter system, and there was a reduction in international trade. People became ever more fearful for their personal safety, and the Imperial Crisis saw an increasing trend toward sacrificing personal liberties and rights in return for guarantees of safety from wealthy landowners. All of this foreshadowed the emergence of the European feudal system and serfdom. These were obviously turbulent times, and given the volatility, many historians have debated how the Roman Empire managed to survive in any form at all, let alone remain robust enough to allow Diocletian to restore order.",58,History,en,179692296X,crisis of third century
Constantine the Great The Man and His Times,Michael Grant,Macmillan Reference USA,1994,"""The Emperor Constantine was one of the great, charismatic figures of the ancient world. He was directly responsible for two momentous transformations that greatly affected our history and civilization: the founding of Constantinople as the Roman capital and the conversion of the Roman Empire to Christianity. With knowledge gained from modern research in all relevant fields, including archaeology, papyrology, and art history, Michael Grant traces the controversies that surround this intriguing ruler back to their very beginnings. He draws a compelling portrait of Constantine, assessing the emperor's achievements as a general in command of his armies and as a resourceful politician and reformer."" ""In art, politics, economics, social developments, and particularly in religion, the life of Constantine acts as a bridge between past and present. Michael Grant goes beyond the bias of literary sources and reveals the private man behind the public persona: the superstitious beliefs underpinning Constantine's hallucinatory visions and dreams that heralded his conversion to Christianity; his persecution of paganism in the name of Christianity that set precedents for centuries to come; and the relationship between church and state that gave way to the totalitarianism of the Late Roman Empire. Was he the last notable Roman emperor, or the first medieval monarch? Was the great convert a saint and hero, or should we regard him as a murderer who killed his wife, his eldest son, and many of his friends to further his own ambitions? These are just some of the issues raised in this revelatory biography.""--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Life of Constantine the Great,Joseph Fletcher,CreateSpace,2014-11-01,"It would be hard if not outright impossible to overstate the impact Roman Emperor Constantine I had on the history of Christianity, Ancient Rome, and Europe as a whole. Best known as Constantine the Great, the kind of moniker only earned by rulers who have distinguished themselves in battle and conquest, Constantine remains an influential and controversial figure to this day. He achieved enduring fame by being the first Roman emperor to personally convert to Christianity, and for his notorious Edict of Milan, the imperial decree which legalized the worship of Christ and promoted religious freedom throughout the Empire. More than 1500 years after Constantine's death, Abdu'l-Bahá, the head of the Bahá'í Faith, wrote, ""His blessed name shines out across the dawn of history like the morning star, and his rank and fame among the world's noblest and most highly civilized is still on the tongues of Christians of all denominations""Moreover, even though he is best remembered for his religious reforms and what his (mostly Christian) admirers described as his spiritual enlightenment, Constantine was also an able and effective ruler in his own right. Rising to power in a period of decline and confusion for the Roman Empire, he gave it a new and unexpected lease on life by repelling the repeated invasions of the Germanic tribes on the Northern and Eastern borders of the Roman domains, even going so far as to re-expand the frontier into parts of Trajan's old conquest of Dacia (modern Romania), which had been abandoned as strategically untenable. However, it can be argued that despite his military successes - the most notable of which occurred fighting for supremacy against other Romans - Constantine may well have set the stage for the ultimate collapse of the Roman Empire as it had existed up until that point. It was Constantine who first decided that Rome, exposed and vulnerable near the gathering masses of barbarians moving into Germania and Gaul, was a strategically unsafe base for the Empire, and thus expanded the city of New Rome on the Dardanelles straits, creating what eventually became Constantinople. By moving the political, administrative and military capital of the Empire from Rome to the East, as well as the Imperial court with all its attendant followers, Constantine laid the groundwork for the eventual schism which saw the two parts of the Roman Empire become two entirely separate entities, go their own way, and eventually collapse piecemeal under repeated waves of invasion.",62,,en,150324556X,constantine the great

Constantine (Routledge Revivals),Ramsay MacMullen,Routledge,2014-06-17,"This study, first published in 1969, presents an astute and authoritative depiction of the cultural, religious and secular developments which shook the Roman world in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries AD, much of it under the auspices of the Emperor, Constantine the Great. Constantine was at the heart of the transition from pagan antiquity to Christendom. Rejecting the collegiate imperial system of his recent predecessors, he reunited the two halves of the Empire; established Christianity as its formal religion; and shifted the capital of the Roman world definitively to the city which would survive the collapse of the West and persevere for another thousand years, Constantinople. The general reader will enjoy Constantine as a lucidly composed and accessible synthesis of ancient sources and modern contributions to the study of this towering figure.",197,History,en,9781317744467,constantine the great

The book is an epic retelling of one of the last great battles of the Western Roman Empire.

"Principles of Water Law and Administration National and International, 3rd Edition","Dante A. Caponera, Marcella Nanni",Routledge,2019-05-03,"This book, which was first published in 1992 and then updated in 2007, provides a tool for dealing with the legal and institutional aspects of water resources management within national contexts and at the level of transboundary water resources. Like its two previous editions, it seeks to cover all aspects that need to be known in order to attain good water governance, but it provides updates concerning developments since 2007. These relate, inter alia, to the following: - the “greening” of water law, which calls for the progressive integration of environmental law principles into domestic and international water law; - the adoption, by the International Law Commission in 2008, of the Draft Articles on the Law of Transboundary Aquifers, and subsequent developments; - the emergence of the right to water as a self-standing human right; - the adoption of domestic water laws supporting integrated water resources management (IWRM) and enhanced public participation in planning and decision making; - the integration into these laws of tools facilitating adaptive water management as a response to climate variability and change; - progress in the implementation of EU law; - recent international agreements and judicial decisions; - efforts of regional organizations other than the EU to steer cooperation in the management of transboundary water resources and the harmonization of national laws; - institutional mechanisms for the management of transboundary water resources (surface and underground). Unique in its scope and nature, the book identifies the legal and institutional issues arising in connection with water resources management and provides guidelines for possible solutions in a manner accessible to a wide range of readers. Thus, it is a useful reference for lawyers and non-lawyers — engineers, hydrologists, hydrogeologists, economists, sociologists — dealing with water resources within government institutions, river basin commissions, international organizations, financing institutions and academic institutions, among other things, and also for students of disciplines related to water resources.",463,Law,en,9780429879425,ripuarian franks
Time to Lead Lessons for Today's Leaders from Bold Decisions that Changed History,Jan-Benedict Steenkamp,Greenleaf Book Group,2020-09-15,"Where is leadership when we need it? What can today’s corporate, non-profit, military, and public-service leaders learn from daring decisions that changed history? In Time to Lead, Jan-Benedict Steenkamp presents a fresh examination of history-making leaders by holding a magnifying glass up to a life-changing dilemma each of them faced. What we learn is how powerful the personalities of leaders and their decision-making processes can be in determining the course of human events—and the fates of millions of people. Steenkamp explains how these great men and women arrived at the solutions to the problems they confronted by virtue of their character traits and whether they were foxes or hedgehogs—as in the ancient parable—or, as he further categorizes, eagles or ostriches. Sixteen carefully curated case studies hold powerful lessons that today’s leaders can apply in their own professional lives. Readers will recognize Roosevelt, Washington, Mandela, Thatcher, Alexander the Great, and MLK, but other lesser-known leaders, such as Themistocles, Clovis, Peter, Fisher, and Nightingale provide equally valuable insights into how individuals make decisions based upon one of seven leadership styles (adaptive, persuasive, directive, disruptive, authentic, servant, and charismatic) and four personality classifications (hedgehog, fox, eagle, or ostrich). Steenkamp’s assessment tools provide seasoned and aspiring leaders alike with the means to not only determine their own individual styles, but how to step up when they inevitably come face-to-face with their own moments of truth. Chapter takeaways, leadership principles, and open-ended, reflective questions will confer encouragement, enrichment, and empowerment on readers when they realize they can utilize the same tactics as these leaders in their own lives. Time to Lead is about great men and women, their actions in leadership that have withstood the test of time, what we can learn from them—and the lessons that are relevant for us here and now.",534,Business & Economics,en,9781734324839,ripuarian franks
The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians,J. B. Bury,DigiCat,2022-11-13,"J. B. Bury's ""The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians"" stands as a critical examination of the tumultuous transformations in Europe during the early medieval period. With a focus on the interactions and conflicts between the Roman Empire and various barbarian tribes, Bury employs a meticulous narrative style rich in historical detail. He delves into the socio-political contexts that shaped these encounters, weaving a tapestry that illustrates how these invasions fundamentally altered the cultural and political landscape of Europe. The book is both a product of its time, reflecting early 20th-century historiographical debates, and a timeless analysis of civilization in flux. Bury, a prominent historian and a professor at the University of Dublin, was greatly influenced by his background in classical studies and his keen interest in the decline of the Roman Empire. His research draws from a breadth of ancient sources, showcasing his commitment to rigorous scholarship. Bury's historical lens is colored by the cultural and political currents of his time, particularly the rising nationalism and the ongoing discourse on identity within Europe. ""The Invasion of Europe by the Barbarians"" is highly recommended for anyone intrigued by the complexities of European history and the legacy of the so-called 'barbarians.' Bury's insightful analyses provide not just a narrative of invasions, but a deeper understanding of the forces that shaped modern Europe, making this work essential reading for historians, students, and general readers alike.",176,History,en,,ripuarian franks

The Laws of the Salian Franks,,University of Pennsylvania Press,2012-05-23,"Following the collapse of the western Roman Empire, the Franks established in northern Gaul one of the most enduring of the Germanic barbarian kingdoms. They produced a legal code (which they called the Salic law) at approximately the same time that the Visigoths and Burgundians produced theirs, but the Frankish code is the least Romanized and most Germanic of the three. Unlike Roman law, this code does not emphasize marriage and the family, inheritance, gifts, and contracts; rather, Lex Salica is largely devoted to establishing fixed monetary or other penalties for a wide variety of damaging acts such as ""killing women and children,"" ""striking a man on the head so that the brain shows,"" or ""skinning a dead horse without the consent of its owner."" An important resource for students and scholars of medieval and legal history, made available once again in Katherine Fischer Drew's expert translation, the code contains much information on Frankish judicial procedure. Drew has here rendered into readable English the Pactus Legis Salicae, generally believed to have been issued by the Frankish King Clovis in the early sixth century and modified by his sons and grandson, Childbert I, Chlotar I, and Chilperic I. In addition, she provides a translation of the Lex Salica Karolina, the code as corrected and reissued some three centuries later by Charlemagne.",267,History,en,9780812200508,salian franks

Ammianus' Julian Narrative and Genre in the Res Gestae,Alan J. Ross,Oxford University Press,2016-06-17,"Ammianus Marcellinus' Res Gestae holds a prominent position in modern studies of the emperor Julian as the fullest extant narrative of the reign of the last 'pagan' emperor. Ammianus' Julian: Narrative and Genre in the Res Gestae offers a major reinterpretation of the work, which is one of the main narrative sources for the political history of the later Roman Empire, and argues for a re-examination of Ammianus' agenda and methods in narrating the reign of Julian. Building on recent developments in the application of literary approaches and critical theories to historical texts, Ammianus' presentation of Julian is evaluated by considering the Res Gestae within three interrelated contexts: as a work of Latin historiography, which consciously sets itself within a classical and classicizing generic tradition; in a more immediate literary and political context, as the final contribution by a member of an 'eyewitness' generation to a quarter century of intense debate over Julian's legacy by several authors who had lived through his reign and had been in varying degrees of proximity to Julian himself; and as a narrative text, in which narratorial authority is closely associated with the persona of the narrator, both as an external narrating agent and an occasional participant in the events he relates. This is complemented by a literary survey and a re-analysis of Ammianus' depiction of several key moments in Julian's reign, such as his appointment as Caesar, the battle of Strasbourg in 357AD, his acclamation as Augustus, and the disastrous invasion of Persia in 363AD. It suggests that the Res Gestae presents a Latin-speaking, western audience with an idiosyncratic and 'Romanized' depiction of the philhellene emperor and that, consciously exploiting his position as a Greek writing in Latin and as a contemporary of Julian, Ammianus wished his work to be considered a culminating and definitive account of the man and his life.",272,History,en,9780191087851,ammianus marcellinus

Ammianus Marcellinus,Ammianus Marcellinus,,1935,"Ammianus (c. 325-c. 395 CE), a Greek from Antioch, served many years as an officer in the Roman army, then settled in Rome, where he wrote a Latin history of the Roman Empire. The portion that survives covers twenty-five years in the historian's own lifetime: the reigns of Constantius, Julian, Jovian, Valentinian I, and Valens. Ammianus Marcellinus, ca. 325-ca. 395 CE, a Greek of Antioch, joined the army when still young and served under the governor Ursicinus and the emperor of the East Constantius II, and later under the emperor Julian, whom he admired and accompanied against the Alamanni and the Persians.

Many contemporaries were of the opinion that this defeat heralded the decline of the Empire.

Parker, Jr., has emerged as America’s most influential and articulate authority on wine. Whether he writes of the fabled French châteaux or of lesser-known growers and producers from around the world, his books have proved invaluable reading for connoisseurs and neophytes alike, for they contain not only hard-headed, frank analysis but an undisguised and positively contagious enthusiasm for his subject. In this book, his most ambitious and comprehensive to date, Parker offers an extraordinary guide to the growers, appellations, and wines of Burgundy, the viticultural region in eastern France that produces the most exotic, sought-after, expensive, and frequently least understood wines in the world. Like its predecessors, Bordeaux and The Wines of the RhOne Valley and Provence, Parker’s Burgundy has all the makings of a classic. It is a beautifully produced book, and it boasts more than thirty specially made color maps, with those depicting the individual appellations drawn in such exquisite detail that each and every vineyard is visible.

Burgundy The Global Story of Terroir,Marion Demossier,Berghahn Books,2018-04-23,"“Demossier’s engrossing analysis of Burgundy—the wine, the place, the brand—should be imbibed (pun intended!) on many levels—and slowly, for best appreciation.”—foodanthro.com Drawing on more than twenty years of fieldwork, this book explores the professional, social, and cultural world of Burgundy wines, the role of terroir (the environmental factors that affect a crop's character), and its transnational deployment in China, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. It demystifies the terroir ideology by providing a unique long-term ethnographic analysis of what lies behind the concept. While the Burgundian model of terroir has gone global by acquiring UNESCO world heritage status, its very legitimacy is now being challenged amongst the vineyards where it first took root. From the introduction: Superficially then, Burgundy might appear to be simply acquiring recognition for its unchanging landscape, tradition and culture. Yet, for all the power of its rich local identity, folklore and culture which is broadcast to the world, there hides underneath the comforting blanket of this seamless place, untouched by change or conflict, a far more complex reality. Burgundy’s listing as a World Heritage landscape emphasises its international reputation as a traditional and historical site of wine production and opens a new chapter in the production and marketing of its quality, differentiation and authenticity. It is also about readjusting Burgundy and the grands crus in response to a changing global market and the shifting kaleidoscope of world wine values.",280,Social Science,en,9781785338526,burgundy
George Chastelain and the Shaping of Valois Burgundy Political and Historical Culture at Court in the Fifteenth Century,Graeme Small,Boydell & Brewer Ltd,1997,"Few texts offer as many insights into the history of Valois Burgundy as the work of George Chastelain (c.1414-1475), official chronicler to the dukes Philip the Good and Charles the Bold.

This is the first historical study of Chastelain in over half a century. An account of his life and career is followed by a study of the chronicle, Chastelain's interpretation within it of ducal actions and aspirations, and the role it played in the historical culture of the governing classes in the Netherlands after the death of the last duke in 1477.

Climbing the Vines in Burgundy How an American Came to Own a Legendary Vineyard in France,Alex Gambal,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2024-10-03,"Named one of the New York Times Best Wine Books of 2023 Named one of the Washington Post's Best Wine Books of 2023 In the late 1980s, while working for his family's real estate and parking business in Washington, DC, Alex received a life-changing case of wine as a gift that uncorked a new opportunity. In 1993, he and his family moved to Burgundy, France. They were welcomed as the Gambals, not as interloping Americans, into a community of distinguished winemakers. Over the next 26 years, Gambal straddled the Atlantic while creating Domaine Alex Gambal, a boutique Burgundy winery that included some of France's greatest vineyards. He produced 35 appellations, including Grand Cru Batard Montrachet. A hard-nosed-businessman in a community steeped in tradition, Gambal defeated the odds by buying some of the most coveted French vines and creating a successful brand. His American’s sensibility gave him a special place in the hearts and minds of Burgundy’s vignerons. Climbing the Vines in Burgundy is a sensory experience that you won’t soon forget. It’s also a touching family memoir and an accessible, incredibly detailed look at the worlds of gastronomy and oenology. Gambal’s book is populated with fascinating characters, stunning locales, and delectable depictions of meals and glass after glass after glass of wine.",346,Biography & Autobiography,en,9781538196182,burgundy
Economy and Society in Burgundy Since 1850,Robert Aldrich,Taylor & Francis,2023-01-20,"First Published in 1984 Economy and Society in Burgundy Since 1850 provides a comprehensive overview of the modern history of Burgundy. Burgundy is best known for its wine and its capital of Dijon is most often associated with mustard. Yet the region’s modern history is more than a history of gastronomy. The coming of the railways in the 1850s greatly changed the economic life of the area, spurring the growth of Dijon and contributing to rural depopulation. Agricultural crises throughout the nineteenth century, such as phylloxera epidemic in the vineyards, caused further dislocation in rural life. Even in the twentieth century, the countryside remained agricultural while the city of Dijon owes its dynamism to the expansion of the service sector rather than to heavy industry. This book argues that this evolution -modernisation without industrialization- is not a matter of economic retardation but of the suitability of the region’s natural resources and the intentional choice of its population. Rich in archival sources this book is an interesting read for scholars and researchers of French history, European history, and modern history.",194,History,en,9781000816051,burgundy
The Companion Guide to Burgundy,"Robert Speaight, Francis Pagan",Companion Guides,1996,"For anyone planning a visit to Burgundy this Guide is indispensable. TIMES LITERARY SUPPLEMENT As elegant as it is exhaustive. The whole book has body and bouquet, [its author] is well-read, witty, relaxed and impeccably observant. GUARDIAN Burgundy is one of the richest areas in France - rich in its art and architecture, its history, its food and wines, and its glorious countryside. Nowhere in Europe are there greater examples of the Romanesque: the basilica of the Madeleine at Vézelay, the sculptures of Gislebertus of Autun, the cathedral of St Philibert at Tournus. The very names of its vineyards - Corton, Chambertin, Montrachet - conjure up the robust and mature bouquet of the province. Once the abbeys at Cluny, Pontigny and Fontenay were the wellspring of medieval Christianity in Europe; now the spiritual community at Taizé speaks to the whole world. Nowhere in France is the sense of the past more immediate, nowhere does it so palpably inform the present.

In the Shadow of Burgundy The Court of Guelders in the Late Middle Ages,Gerard Nijsten,Cambridge University Press,2004-02-26,"In recent years the study of medieval courts has become a flourishing field. The courts of kings and popes, or of the Burgundian dukes, have usually attracted most attention. This book offers by contrast a wide-ranging study of a little-known, medium-sized court - that of Guelders in the Low Countries. Guelders offers an excellent vantage point for the study of European late medieval court culture. It was surrounded by the vast territories of the dukes of Burgundy, and it felt the growing power of the Valois dukes, yet the duchy managed to remain independent until 1473. Rich archival sources - including a long and virtually unbroken series of ducal accounts - reveal much about the rise of territorial or 'proto-national' awareness and about the role of the court in this process. The book also conveys the striking cultural and political richness of the court, poised between French and German spheres of influence.",502,Art,en,0521820758,burgundy

"The Ideology of Burgundy The Promotion of National Consciousness, 1364-1565","Jonathan Boulton, Jan Veenstra",BRILL,2006-07-01,"This book is a collection of eight essays on the ideology of Burgundy, dealing with the body of ideas, images, institutions and narrative fictions produced at the behest of the Valois dukes to create and maintain their incipient domanial state in the period from roughly 1364 to the 1560s. Nation building requires an ideological framework and the successive dukes, their officers and their court intellectuals all contributed to a self-determinative image of Burgundy which became visible in their literature, in their quest for a regal title, in the foundation of the Order of the Golden Fleece and in their propaganda. The essays approach the themes of the collection from the perspective of several disciplines, and together present a well-rounded picture of Burgundian nation-building. Contributors include: D’A.J.D.

Through Burgundy by Boat (a Leisurely Guide for Sightseers),"Brenda Davison, Joy Honeyford",Lulu.com,2014-04-04,"This book is as much a treasure to the boat owner as a glass of Pinot Noir to the discerning wine lover.

Rich in history, this area of France needs time to explore and without this book it would be easy to miss the history dating from Caesar's Gallic wars to Middle Ages' architecture and to modern times. For example the gates on the staircase of locks on the Canal du Nivernais are all different because of destruction in WWII by the Resistance to prevent the German Army from using it as a supply line. The town of Gien - 80%%%%%%%% destroyed by the Germans in 1940, and by the Allies in 1944 - has been harmoniously restored using traditional brick patterning and chevrons.

The Eurasian Way of War Military Practice in Seventh-Century China and Byzantium,David A. Graff,Routledge,2016-03-10,"This book is a comparative study of military practice in Sui-Tang China and the Byzantine Empire between approximately 600 and 700 CE. It covers all aspects of the military art from weapons and battlefield tactics to logistics, campaign organization, military institutions, and the grand strategy of empire. Whilst not neglecting the many differences between the Chinese and Byzantines, this book highlights the striking similarities in their organizational structures, tactical deployments and above all their extremely cautious approach to warfare. It shows that, contrary to the conventional wisdom positing a straightforward Western way of war and an ""Oriental"" approach characterized by evasion and trickery, the specifics of Byzantine military practice in the seventh century differed very little from what was known in Tang China. It argues that these similarities cannot be explained by diffusion or shared cultural influences, which were limited, but instead by the need to deal with common problems and confront common enemies, in particular the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian steppes. Overall, this book provides compelling evidence that pragmatic needs may have more influence than deep cultural imperatives in determining a society’s ""way of war.""",258,History,en,9781317237082,strategikon
The Danube Frontier,Michael Schmitz,Pen and Sword Military,2015-08-30,"The Roman conquests of Macedonia in the 2nd century BC led directly to the extension of their authority over the troublesome tribes of Thrace to the south of the Danube. But their new neighbor on the other side of the mighty river, the kingdom of the Dacians, was to pose an increasing threat to the Roman empire. Inevitably, this eventually provoked Roman attempts at invasion and conquest. It is a measure of Dacian prowess and resilience that several tough campaigns were required over more than a century before their kingdom was added to the Roman Empire. It was one of the Empire's last major acquisitions (and a short-lived one at that). Dr. Michael Schmitz traces Roman involvement in the Danube region from first contact with the Thracians after the Third Macedonian War in the 2nd century BC to the ultimate conquest of Dacia by Trajan in the early years of the 2nd Century AD. Like the other volumes in this series, this book gives a clear narrative of the course of these wars, explaining how the Roman war machine coped with formidable new foes and the challenges of unfamiliar terrain and climate.

The Role of Migration in the History of the Eurasian Steppe Sedentary Civilization vs. 'Barbarian' and Nomad,NA NA,Springer,2016-04-30,"Throughout their entire history, the sedentary civilizations of China and Europe had to deal with nomads and barbarians. This unique volume explores their drastically different responses: China 'chose' containment while Europe 'chose' expansion. Migration played a crucial role in this interaction. Issuing from two population centers, the sedentary one in the West and the nomadic one in the East, two powerful population streams confronted each other in the Eurasian Steppe. This confrontation was a crucial factor in determining patterns of Eurasian history - it destroyed existing states, created new ones, and drastically changed the balance of power. Even today, while Russian populations in Asia contract, the population pressures in China and Central Asia continue to build and are likely to spill over across the border. This book shows how we are witnessing the beginning of a new cycle of the age-old contest.",352,History,en,9781349618378,sabirs
Social Orders and Social Landscapes,"Charles W. Hartley, Laura M. Popova, Adam T. Smith",Cambridge Scholars Publishing,2021-02-10,"Social Orders and Social Landscapes marks a new direction in research for Eurasian archaeology that focuses on how people lived in their local environment and interacted with their near and distant neighbours, rather than on overarching comparisons of archaeological culture complexes. Stemming from the 2005 University of Chicago Eurasian Archaeology Conference, the papers collected here reflect this new research agenda, though the way in which each author addressed the theme of the conference, and thus the book, was strikingly varied. This diversity arises out of the field’s intellectual flux driven by the principled engagement of the rich analytical traditions of the Soviet/CIS, Anglo-American, and European schools. Despite the variability in approaches and subject matter, several key themes emerged: 1) the reinterpretation culture categories by examining particular aspects of social life; 2) the role social memory plays in the production of landscape and place; 3) the influence of the built environment on societies; and 4) the ways in which economic considerations affect social orders and landscapes. The result is a book that helps to re-image Eurasia as a complex landscape fragmented by historically contingent and shifting ecological and social boundaries rather than a bounded mosaic of culture areas or environmental zones. “Scholarly research on Eurasia was transformed by the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Entire areas and fields of research became accessible to European and American scholars for the first time, resulting in the emergence of new centers specializing in primary field investigations throughout the vast, politically transformed landmass of Eurasia. One such center is the University of Chicago that has recently sponsored two large international conferences on Eurasian archaeology. Social Orders and Social Landscapes is the product of the second Chicago conference held in spring 2005. The editors of the volume should be proud of their efforts that have resulted in such a broad ranging and prompt publication. The articles encompass a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including archaeology, history, art history, palynology, and zooarchaeology; extend chronologically from Neolithic and Bronze Age times to the formation of national identity in Turkey in the early 20th century; and range geographically from Europe to China. Several articles reconstruct basic subsistence activities; others analyze distinctive settlement types and political and cultural frontiers, including the assimilation and emergence of new, self-defined ethnic groups and the selective adoption of new systems of religious belief. What unites this diverse collection is their consistent emphasis on the social construction of reality and the production of social landscapes and memories that altered perceptions of the physical world and mediated the practical activities that here have been convincingly reconstructed from the archaeological record. In so doing, rigid stereotypes are questioned and novel interpretations persuasively advanced. Early Bronze Age pastoralism on the south Russian steppes did not consist exclusively of herding animals nor was it combined, as it was later in the Iron Age, with the pursuit of agriculture; rather, D. Anthony and D. Brown suggest that at least in the Samara river valley the herding of animals occurred along side the intensive gathering of wild, nutritionally rich plants. The kalas of ancient Chorasmia are not cities, nor even proto-urban formations, but rather are large, heavily fortified enclosures meant to repel attacks of armed nomadic cavalry. They represent a continuation of a distinct Central Asian settlement pattern that began in the Bronze Age and that formed the center of a landscape divided into contiguous, self-contained oases. The Mongols not only herded livestock, but also farmed, fished, hunted, and traded throughout the vast area that they had conquered, uniting most of Eurasia into a single, economically integrated system. New perspectives proliferate throughout this richly detailed and extremely broad ranging collected volume.” — Phil Kohl, Professor of Anthropology and the Kathryn W. Davis Professor of Slavic Studies at Wellesley College “ “Social Orders and Social Landscapes” is a stimulating addition to the still small literature in English making the rich datasets from the archaeology of Eurasia widely accessible to Western scholars. The authors of the eighteen chapters analyze data from China to the Mediterranean, from the fourth millennium BCE through the fourteenth century CE, with the tools of art and architectural history, text analysis, paleobotany and paleozoology, and anthropological theory, among others. The product of a conference at the University of Chicago, this book fulfils the goal of the graduate student organizers to apply interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the archaeology and history of the Eurasian landmass in local terms through a focus on “how people lived in their local environments.” In the decade and a half since the end of the Soviet Union, scholarly communication has broadened and the mutual influences have stimulated many new and thought provoking views on the Eurasian past. This book is an exemplary product of the new scholarly discourse.” — Karen S.

Military History of Late Rome 565–602,Ilkka Syvänne,Pen and Sword Military,2022-09-21,"A fresh analysis of the Roman Empire in the aftermath of the reconquests of Justinian I. It is often claimed that Justinian overstretched the Roman resources, but the analysis in Military History of Late Rome 565-602 proves that view wrong. It demonstrates that the initial troubles were largely the result of the mistakes of Justin II, and that his successors, Tiberius II and Maurice, not only restored its fortunes but were, at the time of Maurice’s death, actually poised to complete the reconquests of Justinian. It was thanks to the reforms of Maurice, which were codified in the military treatise the Strategikon, that the Roman army had achieved a position of relative superiority over all of its enemies—so that by 602 the Romans had decisively defeated the Persians, Slavs, and Avars. These gains, however, were lost when Maurice was murdered in a military mutiny that brought Phocas to power. This volume explains why the Roman army overthrew one of the greatest Roman emperors who ever lived. This was an era of epic battles, so the author also pays particular attention to the period tactics and analyzes all the period battles in great detail. These include such battles as Melitene, Constantia, Sirmium, Nymphius River, Solanchon, Lake Urmiah, Plain of Canzak, Iatrus, and the epic battles of Priscus and Comentiolus in the Balkans.

Packaging Post/Coloniality The Manufacture of Literary Identity in the Francophone World,Richard Watts,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2005-04-14,"In Packaging Post/Coloniality, Richard Watts breaks from convention and reads Francophone books by their covers, focusing on the package over the content. Watts looks at the ways that the ""paratext""-the covers, illustrations, promotional summaries, epigraphs, dedications, and prefaces or forewords that enclose the text-mediates creative works by writers from sub-Saharan Africa, the Maghreb, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia whose place in the French literary institution was and remains a source of conflict. In order to be acceptable for French bookstore shelves, the novels, essays, and collections of poetry created in colonial territories were deemed to need explanation and sponsorship by an authority in the field. Watts finds the French mission civilisatrice, or ""civilizing mission,"" manifest in prefaces, introductions, and dedications inserted in the books that appeared in the metropole during the height of French imperialism. In the postcolonial era, book packaging reveals a struggle to reverse the power dynamic: Francophone writers introduced each others' texts, yet books still appeared with covers promoting stereotypical images of the Francophone world. This fascinating journey through a particular cultural history of the book is a unique take on the quest for a literary identity. Watts concludes his study by looking at English mediations of Francophone works, with a chapter on reading and teaching Francophone literature in translation.",201,History,en,9781978777309,sabirs
Secrets of a Lost Empire: Unraveling the Enigma of the Khazars,Pasquale De Marco,Pasquale De Marco,2025-04-14,"Immerse yourself in the captivating world of the Khazars, a Turkic people who, in a remarkable twist of fate, adopted Judaism as their official religion in the 8th century. Their empire, the Khazar Khaganate, flourished for centuries as a vibrant crossroads of cultures and religions, a beacon of tolerance and diversity in a turbulent world. In this comprehensive exploration, we delve into the heart of the Khazar Khaganate, uncovering their unique blend of nomadic and settled lifestyles, their sophisticated political and economic systems, and their remarkable religious tolerance. From the vast steppes of Central Asia to the shores of the Caspian Sea, we trace the Khazars' fascinating interactions with neighboring civilizations, from the Byzantine Empire to the Islamic Caliphate, from the Vikings to the Mongols. Through meticulous research and analysis, we unravel the Khazars' pivotal role in shaping the geopolitical landscape of Eurasia, shedding light on their military prowess, their contributions to trade and commerce, and their profound impact on the course of history. We examine intriguing questions that continue to puzzle scholars to this day: What were the motivations behind their conversion to Judaism? How did they manage to maintain religious freedom and harmony in a region often marred by religious strife? What factors contributed to their ultimate disappearance from the historical record? By seeking answers to these questions, we not only shed light on the Khazars' past but also gain valuable perspectives on contemporary issues of identity, migration, and the coexistence of diverse cultures. This book is a testament to the enduring legacy of the Khazars, whose story transcends time and continues to inspire and fascinate readers to this day. Within these pages, you will find a tapestry of history, culture, and intrigue, a story that is both captivating and thought-provoking. Discover the secrets of a lost empire, unravel the mysteries of a vanished people, and pay tribute to the enduring legacy of the Khazars.

The book’s main goal is to provide, for the first time in English, a comprehensive source for those interested in the variety of states, constitutional and public legal orders which have succeeded one another during Transylvania’s tumultuous history. It serves to underline the region’s uniqueness as a space where (for better or worse) several nationalities, multiple religions and varied cultures have had to find a way to get along, under the pressures of external state and constitutional orders. It seeks to show both the positive and the negative solutions found, which advanced or hindered this goal of organised coexistence.",382,Law,en,9783031221668,onoghurs

The Roman World from Romulus to Muhammad A New History,Greg Fisher,Routledge,2021-09-21,"This volume provides a detailed examination of nearly 1,400 years of Roman history, from the foundation of the city in the eighth century BC until the evacuation of Roman troops from Alexandria in AD 642 in the face of the Arab conquests. Drawing on a vast array of ancient texts written in Latin, Greek, Syriac, Armenian, and Arabic, and relying on a host of inscriptions, archaeological data, and the evidence from ancient art, architecture, and coinage, The Roman World from Romulus to Muhammad brings to the fore the men and women who chronicled the story of the city and its empire.

The author also considers the development of Islam within a Roman historical context, examines the events that led to the formation of the post-Roman states in Western Europe, and contemplates aff airs on the imperial periphery in the Caucasus, Ethiopia, and the Arabian Peninsula.

The Jews of Khazaria,Kevin Alan Brook,"Jason Aronson, Incorporated",1999,"""The Jews of Khazaria recounts the eventful history of the kingdom of Khazaria, which was located in eastern Europe and flourished as an independent state from about 650 to 1016. In the ninth century, the Khazarian royalty and nobility as well as a significant portion of the Khazarian population embraced the Jewish religion. As a major world power, Khazaria enjoyed diplomatic and trade relations with many peoples and nations and changed the course of medieval history in many ways. After their conversion, the Khazars were ruled by a succession of Jewish kings and began to adopt the hallmarks of Jewish civilization, including the Torah and Talmud, the Hebrew script, and the observance of Jewish holidays. A portion of the empires population adopted Christianity and Islam. This volume traces the development of the Khazars from their early beginnings as a tribe to the decline and fall of their kingdom. It also examines the many migrations of the Khazar people into Hungary, Ukraine, and other area of Europe and their subsequent assimilation, providing the most comprehensive treatment of this complex issue to date. The final chapter enumerates the Jewish communities of eastern Europe which sprung up after the fall of Khazaria and proposes that the Jews from the former Russian Empire are descended from a mixture of Khazar Jews, German Jews, Greek Jews, and Slavs. The Jews of Khazaria draws upon the latest archival, linguistic, and archaeological discoveries. Ashkenazic Jews who wish to explore their distant ancestry in eastern Europe will greatly benefit from reading this book. Additionally, Hungarians, Slavs, Turks, Arabs and Ossetians will find a wealth of information concerning the historical interactions between their peoples and the Khazars. Students of history who desire a thorough yet easy-to-read account of the Khazar kingdom will gain in their understanding of this important but previously obscure topic."" -- Publisher's description",382,History,en,,onoghurs

The Huns,Hyun Jin Kim,Routledge,2015-11-19,"This volume is a concise introduction to the history and culture of the Huns. This ancient people had a famous reputation in Eurasian Late Antiquity. However, their history has often been evaluated as a footnote in the histories of the later Roman Empire and early Germanic peoples. Kim addresses this imbalance and challenges the commonly held assumption that the Huns were a savage people who contributed little to world history, examining striking geopolitical changes brought about by the Hunnic expansion over much of continental Eurasia and revealing the Huns' contribution to European, Iranian, Chinese and Indian civilization and statecraft. By examining Hunnic culture as a Eurasian whole, The Huns provides a full picture of their society which demonstrates that this was a complex group with a wide variety of ethnic and linguistic identities. Making available critical information from both primary and secondary sources regarding the Huns' Inner Asian origins, which would otherwise be largely unavailable to most English speaking students and Classical scholars, this is a crucial tool for those interested in the study of Eurasian Late Antiquity.",208,History,en,9781317340911,utigurs

A Cultural History of Bathing in Late Antiquity and Early Byzantium,Michal Zytka,Routledge,2019-03-28,"This book discusses social, religious and medical attitudes towards bathing in Late Antiquity. It examines the place of bathing in late Roman and early Byzantine society as seen in the literary, historical, and documentary sources from the late antique period. The author argues that bathing became one of the most important elements in defining what it meant to be a Roman; indeed, the social and cultural value of bathing in the context of late Roman society more than justified the efforts and expense put into preserving bathing establishments and the associated culture. The book contributes a unique perspective to understanding the changes and transformations undergone by the bathing culture of the day, and illustrates the important role played by this culture in contributing to the transitional character of the late antique period. In his examination of the attitudes of medical professionals and laymen alike, and the focus on its recuperative utility, Zytka provides an innovative and detailed approach to bathing.",222,Health & Fitness,en,9781351134095,utigurs
Historical Dictionary of Byzantium,John H. Rosser,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,2011-12-22,"The Byzantine Empire dates back to Constantine the Great, the first Christian ruler of the Roman Empire, who, in 330 AD, moved the imperial capital from Rome to a port city in modern-day Turkey, which he then renamed Constantinople in his honor. From its founding, the Byzantine Empire was a major anchor of east-west trade, and culture, art, architecture, and the economy all prospered in the newly Christian empire. As Byzantium moved into the middle and late period, Greek became the official language of both church and state and the Empire’s cultural and religious influence extended well beyond its boundaries. In the mid-15th century, the Ottoman Turks put an end to 1,100 years of Byzantine history by capturing Constantinople, but the Empire’s legacy in art, culture, and religion endured long after its fall. In this revised and updated second edition of the Historical Dictionary of Byzantium, author John H. Rosser introduces both the general reader and the researcher to the history of the Byzantine Empire. This comprehensive dictionary includes detailed, alphabetical entries on key figures, ideas, places, and themes related to Byzantine art, history, and religion, and the second edition contains numerous additional entries on broad topics such as transportation and gender, which were less prominent in the previous edition. An expanded introduction introduces the reader to Byzantium and a guide to further sources and suggested readings can be found in the extensive bibliography that follows the entries. A basic chronology and various maps and illustrations are also included in the dictionary. This book is an excellent access point for students, researchers, and anyone wanting to know more about Byzantium.",643,History,en,9780810874770,utigurs

Geopolitics in Late Antiquity The Fate of Superpowers from China to Rome,Hyun Jin Kim,Routledge,2018-10-26,"Geopolitics in Late Antiquity explores the geopolitical revolution which shook the foundations of the ancient world, the dawning of the millennium of Inner Asian dominance and virtual monopoly of world power (with interludes) that began with the rise of the Huns and then continued under the hegemony of various other steppe peoples. Kim examines first the geopolitical situation created by the rise of Inner Asian powers, and then the reactions of the great empires of Eurasia to this geopolitical challenge. A unique feature of this book is its in-depth analysis of the geostrategies (some successful, others misguided) adopted by China, Rome and Persia to cope with the growing Inner Asian threat. The conclusions and insights drawn from this analysis are then used to inform modern geopolitics, mainly the contest for hegemonic power between the United States and China. Geopolitics in Late Antiquity is a crucial resource for both academic and learned general readership, who have an interest in the fate of antiquity’s superpowers and also for those engaged in current international relations policy-making, who wish to learn from historical precedents.",237,History,en,9781351869263,akatziri
Attila the Hun Arch-Enemy of Rome,Ian Hughes,Casemate Publishers,2019-09-30,"A biography of the notorious tribal leader whose empire challenged the Romans. Most know the name Attila the Hun—but few are familiar with the full history behind this historical figure. Rising to the Hunnic kingship around 434, he dominated European history for the next two decades. Attila bullied and manipulated both halves of the Roman Empire, forcing successive emperors to make tribute payments or face invasion. Here, Ian Hughes recounts Attila’s rise to power, attempting to untangle his character and motivations so far as the imperfect sources allow. A major theme is how the two halves of the empire finally united against Attila, prompting his fateful decision to invade Gaul and his subsequent defeat at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plain in 451. Integral to the narrative is analysis of the history of the rise of the Hunnic Empire; the reasons for the Huns’ military success; relations between the Huns and the two halves of the Roman Empire; Attila’s rise to sole power; and Attila’s doomed attempt to bring both halves of the Roman Empire under his dominion.",299,History,en,9781473890329,akatziri
Short-term Empires in World History,"Robert Rollinger, Julian Degen, Michael Gehler",Springer Nature,2020-06-04,"The volume will focus on a comparative level on a specific group of states that are commonly labelled as “empires” and that we encounter through all historical periods. Although they are very successful at the very beginning, like most empires are, this success is very ephemeral and transient. The era of conquest is never followed by a period of consolidation. Collapse and/or reduction to much smaller dimension run as fast as the process of wide-ranging conquest and expansion. The volume singles out a series of such “short-term empires” and aims to provide a methodologically clearly structured as well as a uniform and consistent approach by developing a general set of questions that guarantee the possibility to compare and distinguish. This way it intends to examine not only already well established empires but also to illuminate forgotten ones.",343,History,en,9783658294359,akatziri

Does East Go West? Anthropological Pathways Through Postsocialism,"Christian Giordano, Francois Ruegg, Andrea Boscoboinik",LIT Verlag Münster,2014,Does East Go West? examines the study of post-socialism from an anthropological perspective. These social systems have posed a challenge to anthropological theory that has been the subject of lively exchanges for over 20 years now. Can post-socialism as a concept adequately apply to the current situation in Eastern Europe?

Qaraqalpaqs of the Aral Delta,"David Richardson, Sue Richardson",Prestel Publishing,2012,"This stunning and heavily illustrated volume, the first ever comprehensive study of the Qaraqalpaq people, focuses on their vibrant decorative textile arts, costumes, and dwellings. The Qaraqalpaqs are a Turkic minority inhabiting the huge southern delta of the former Aral Sea. In recent decades, however, their lands have been turned into desert as the sea itself became desiccated - one of the major environmental disasters of our generation. The Qaraqalpaqs had a thriving artistic culture, and this rigorously researched volume introduces Western readers for the first time to the vibrant textiles, costumes, weavings, jewelery, and furnishings of this formerly nomadic people. Filled with photographs taken on location in the yurts in which the Qaraqalpaqs once lived and from museum collections in Qaraqalpaqstan and Russia, many of which are previously unpublished, the book aims to sweep away the myths surrounding their history and culture. The dazzling objects reproduced in this book demonstrate that the Qaraqalpaqs' folk art is every bit as fascinating and worthy as that of their better-known neighbours, the Qazaks, Uzbeks, and Turkmen. This deluxe book is certain to become the standard reference work on this fascinating people and their culture.

Islamic Historiography and 'Bulghar' Identity Among the Tatars and Bashkirs of Russia,Allen Frank,BRILL,2021-10-11,"This extremely timely book deals with the development of Bulghar regional identity among Tatars and Bashkirs, i.e. Volga-Ural Muslims. Based on locally-produced Islamic manuscrips, the book examines how these Muslims manipulated local legends, conversion narratives, and sacred geography to create a body of sacred historiography that expressed a meaningful regional identity, and one which responds to the changing relationship between these Muslims and the Russian state over the nineteenth century. The book also traces the debate between traditionalist supporters and reformist detractors of this sacred historiography in the nineteenth century, and addresses the fate of Bulghar identity in the twentieth century, including its transformation in Soviet and post-Soviet times into a secularized national identity.",245,Social Science,en,9789004492714,bashkirs
"The Rival Powers in Central Asia Or, The Struggle Between England and Russia in the East",Józef Popowski,,1893,"The Rival Powers in Central Asia is an English translation of a work originally published in Vienna in 1890 under the title Antagonismus der Englischen und Russischen Interessen in Asien: Eine Militär-Politische Studie (The antagonism between English and Russian interests in Asia: A military-political study). The study analyzes what the author sees as the threat to British India posed by an aggressive Russia. The author characterizes the Russian Empire as a ""reckless, expansive force,"" which, having reached its natural limits on the seas to the east and the north, was now concentrating ""all its energies on the South, and chiefly in the direction of Constantinople and Central Asia."" While the Russian thrust into Central Asia is portrayed as a threat mainly to British interests, Russian ambitions toward Constantinople are seen as most threatening to the continental European powers, ""Austria in particular,"" which ""cannot at any cost permit Russia to take possession of Constantinople."" On this basis, the author argues that it is in Great Britain's interest to join a ""Central European Coalition"" with Austria-Hungary and imperial Germany. Chapter four, the longest in the book, entitled ""Strategical Relations of the Two States,"" assesses the relative strengths of Russia and Great Britain in a contest for control of Central Asia and ultimately India, with sections on land forces, naval forces, and the transport and logistical routes likely to be used by each power. The concluding chapter discusses the benefits that Great Britain would gain by allying with the Central European powers against Russia, stresses the value to those powers of a British alliance, and argues that only through such an alliance would Britain be able to retain its hold on India. Ultimately, of course, the envisioned alliance did not come about, as some two decades later Great Britain allied with Russia (and France) and against Germany and Austria-Hungary in the great European conflict that came to be known as World War I.",274,Asia,en,,bashkirs

"Turkism in Eurasia Identity, Ideology and Politics",Galina M. Yemelianova,Bloomsbury Publishing,2025-06-26,"Turkism as an idea which emphasizes the Turkic ethnic component in national identity is widely associated with Turks and Turkey. However, many millions of Turkic peoples with distinctive histories, cultures, social and political traditions live outside Turkey. This book discusses the origins and ethno-cultural and political evolution of Tatars, Bashkirs, Azerbaijanis, Uzbeks, Kazakhs and other Turkic peoples of post-Soviet Turkic Eurasia, examining the views of their national leaders and their attitudes towards Anatolian Turks and Turkey. It addresses the geopolitical implications of the increased role of Turkic and Muslim states in the international system; and argues that from the 2000s Turkism became integrated into the national discourses of the new Turkic states and polities, while at the international level it facilitated, rather than shaped, Turkey's cooperation with these states, as well as inter-state relations within the Turkic world. Based on both primary and secondary sources in Russian, Turkish, English and French, the book uses semi-structured interviews with relevant policy-makers, academics and proponents of Turkism; ethnographic observation; archival documents; and contemporary political analysis from Turkic Eurasia and Turkey to provide the first history-based integrated study of the cultural, ideological and political role of Turkism in Eurasia.",237,History,en,9780755650323,uyghur khaganate

The Tibetan Nonviolent Struggle A Strategic and Historical Analysis,Tenzin Dorjee,,2016-06,"Contrary to a perception--fueled by Chinese propaganda during the 2008 Tibetan uprising that the Tibetan struggle is heading toward extremism--this study shows that the movement for Tibetan freedom has since the 1950s moved toward a tighter embrace of nonviolent resistance. The study traces this evolution, analyzing the central themes, purposes, challenges, strategies, tactics and impacts of three major Tibetan uprisings over the past six decades. Tibetans are now waging a quiet, slow-building nonviolent movement, centered on strengthening the Tibetan national and cultural fabric via what the author refers to as ""transformative resistance."" This is happening in an immensely repressive political environment, which shows that there is a way to mobilize people power against even one of the most ruthless regimes in the world.",162,Social Science,en,1943271054,uyghur khaganate

The internal growth of the European economies and the influx of silver from the New World gave Atlantic Europe an increasingly important position in world trade and caused a major shift in inland Asian trade.
